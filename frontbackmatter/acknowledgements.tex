\chapter{Acknowledgments}

%\textit{Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.} Julius Caesar's immortal words have driven me whenever I am faced with moments of doubt. But often, Newton's first law kicked in and my internal drive had to be supported by unbalanced external forces to ensure that the ball kept rolling, no matter what. My foremost gratitude goes to my promoter, Prof. Dr. Jan Carmeliet, for giving me the opportunity to pursue a challenging research topic that called for multiple skill sets. His support, advice, nudges and pushes formed an integral part of my PhD life, along with his nostalgic recollection of his time in the Belgian army. I would particularly like to  thank Dr. Dominique Derome for her overarching role in my research and for always ensuring that I got the best possible infrastructure for learning, collaborating and propagating my research. I would also like to thank Jan and Dominique explicitly for giving me the independence to pursue my research in the directions that appeared promising to me.

%My special thanks goes to Prof. Dr. Manfred Partl and Dr. Lily Poulikakos for their help in material preparation and also for introducing me to the world of porous asphalt. 
%
%I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Gilles Pijaudier-Cabot for agreeing to be on my PhD defense committee and Prof. Dr. Robert Flatt for chairing it and also for breaking the wonderful news that every PhD student hopes for. 
%
%I can't thank enough Dr. Thijs Defraeye for always being available for insightful discussions on both the experimental and modeling works done in this thesis. In particular, I am truly thankful for his constant emphasis on sticking to a plan. 
%
%My early PhD days were made significantly more fruitful by the patience and understanding of Prof. Dr. Peter Moonen, who explained complex fluid dynamics concepts in the clearest of manners. I would also like to express my gratitude to Dr. Francesco Lucci for his patient discussions on CFD modeling and for his enthusiasm towards my research. A special thanks goes to Dr. Aytac Kubilay and Dr. Andrea Radu for sharing their expertise in numerical modeling with me. 
%
%My gratitude also goes out to Dr. Marc Prat for making my research visit to IMFT Toulouse an extremely productive one, albeit one laced with cooked-up stories of after-work activities. I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Jeff Gostick, who, along with Marc, helped me dive deep into the world of pore network modeling. 
%
%I owe special thanks to Martina Koch for her prompt and cheerful administrative assistance and to Karin Schneider for helping me with the doctoral examination procedures.  
%
%I would like to acknowledge the technical assistance of Roger Vonbank and Beat Margelisch. My gratitude also goes out to Stephan Carl for offering his assistance whenever it was needed the most. I would also like to thank Dr. Iwan Jerjen and Dr. Mathieu Plamondon for their help with the CT scans and Guylaine Desmarais for her assistance during the neutron imaging experiments.  

%My days as a PhD student would have been unthinkable without the tremendous company of my colleagues. Without their active participation in the ever-expanding 1 pm lunch group or in the multitude of social events (especially our Movie Nights!) that will forever be etched in my memory, life would have been that much less worth living. Dr. Karol Kulasinski, Dr. Behrooz Ferdowsi, Dr. Marcel Vonlanthen, Georgios Mavromatidis, Boran Morvaj, Marc Hohmann, Dr. Alessandra Patera, Marcelo Parada, Laure Lemrich, Omid Dorostkar, Lento Manickathan, Kevin Prawiranto, Christian Kanesan, Giovanni Langella, Soyoun Son, Jaebong Lee, Dr. Jonas Allegrini, Dr. Kristina Orehounig, Christoph Waibel, Somil Miglani, Chi Zhang, Mingyang Chen, Gianluca Mussetti, Etienne Jeoffroy, Dr. Biruk Hailesilassie, Dr. Andrea Radu: a big thank you! I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the people behind this \LaTeX~template: Marcel, Georgios and Karol. I would also like to thank Lento for introducing me, one step at a time, to the beautiful world of \LaTeX.

%When I needed a break from the rigors of scientific pursuit, I found a welcoming hand in ETH Model United Nations, an organization that I had the privilege to be a part of for 3 years and lead for 1.5 years. All ETH MUN members: you have played a big role in my student life and I will be forever indebted to you!
%
%Words cannot express my gratitude towards ETH Zurich, the university I have been privileged to call mine for almost 6 years, starting from my Masters degree. I promise to repay the faith that was showed to me.
%
%Finally, but very importantly, I would like to thank my family, especially my parents, Suman Lal and Mary Lal, for their constant support and unshakable faith in me. Acha, Amma, Jithu, Nisha: I am what I am because of you!      
%
%To everyone who is reading this, I have a message: Don't believe in messages. Do your research and think with cold-blooded, ruthless logic. And before you realize it, the world will be a better place.
