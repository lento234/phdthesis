abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The k-??{\{}lunate{\}} model is routinely used by wind engineers to computationally model the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Commercial software is typically used, with the default law of the wall used to model the rough ground surface. By setting appropriate profiles for wind velocity and the turbulence quantities at the inlet, it is often assumed that the boundary layer will be maintained up to the buildings or obstructions in the flow. This paper shows that this is not the case, even in the absence of obstructions, and that the velocity and turbulence profiles decay along the fetch under these default conditions. By revisiting previous work, it is shown that the neutral ABL can be maintained along a lengthy fetch but only with a modified law of the wall and with a shear stress applied to the top boundary of the domain. For those practitioners who are not able to adopt this more thorough approach, some measures are suggested to mitigate the decay of the boundary layer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilised to investigate the flow characteristics around tree windbreaks. The efficiency of windbreaks depends on many factors which can be investigated in field experiments, though this is limited due to several reasons such as unstable weather conditions, few measuring points, etc. Fortunately, the investigation is possible via computer simulations. The simulation technique allows the trees to be modelled as a porous media where the aerodynamic properties of the trees are utilised in the model. The trees employed are Black pine trees (Pinus thunbergii) with a drag coefficient value of 0.55. The simulation provides analysis of the effect of gaps between trees, rows of trees, and tree arrangements in reducing wind velocity.The simulations revealed that 0.5. m gap between trees was more effective in reducing wind velocity than 0.75 and 1.0. m. The percentage reduction in velocity at the middle of the tree section for 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0. m gap distance was found to be 71, 65 and 56{\%}, respectively. Two-rows of alternating trees were also found to be more effective than one-row and two-rows of trees. The reduction at the middle of the tree region for one-row and two-rows of trees and two-rows arranged alternately was 71, 88 and 91{\%}, respectively. Results revealed that the percentage reduction in wind velocity measured at distance 15. H, where H is the tree height, for one-row, two-rows of trees and two-rows arranged alternately was approximately 20, 30 and 50{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 IAgrE.},

abstract = {A multiple-source surface energy balance model for use in general circulation models (GCMs) is developed. The model recognizes three biome architectures: closed canopies (e.g. forest), biomes with two distinct canopies (e.g. savannah) and agricultural crops. The model is based on the Penman-Monteith approach and solves for latent and sensible heat flux without the need to specify a surface temperature or humidity. The two canopies and soil layer are allowed to interact through the specification of a within-canopy saturation deficit and temperature. One or two canopy surface resistances and a soil surface resistance can be specified. The model is calibrated for tropical rainforest, tropical savannah and an agricultural crop. Good agreement is obtained for both hourly and long term evaporation. Two responses to soil moisture were identified for the savannah: a long term one and a short term one. The latter relates to the switching of evaporation from a demand controlled to a supply controlled process. Some problems in the specification of roughness lengths for sparse crops lead to errors in the calculation of momentum exchange. Suggestions are made for improvement. Possible applications of the model are discussed. ?? 1993.},

The emphasis in this review is on the biomechanics of open-grown trees typically found in urban areas, rather than trees in forests or plantations. The distinction is not based on species but on their form, because open-grown trees usually grow with considerable branch mass and the dynamic response in winds may be different to other tree forms. Methods of dynamic analysis applied to trees are reviewed. Simple tree models have been developed to understand tree dynamic responses, but these largely ignore the dynamics of branches. More complex models and finite element analyses are developing a multimodal approach to represent the dynamics of branches on trees. Results indicate that material properties play only a limited role in tree dynamics and it is the form and morphology of the tree and branches that can influence the dynamics of trees. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society of Arboriculture.},

Our study examines the range of research approaches and findings regarding the role of urban green infrastructure (UGI) in mitigating urban heat and enhancing human comfort. It provides an overview based on 89 studies, carried out in a range of geographic and climatic regions. We surveyed the distribution of methodologies employed, spatio-temporal scales considered, type and extent of UGI, climatic variables studied and contribution of UGI to ambient air cooling and enhancement of human comfort. It was found that neither the differences in geographic location or in climate conditions had a significant impact on the choice of research approach. The studies, mostly done on limited spatio-temporal scales, have focused on the rate of air cooling by UGI, and to a lesser extent on its impact on thermal comfort. Maximum observed intensities of park cool island (PCI) effects typically ranged between 1.5 °C–3.5 °C, with no apparent correlation to climatic region. However, there is a tendency seen for larger green sites to induce a stronger PCI, whereas well-shading street trees also have a significant cooling and relieving effect.},

Reproduction of the configuration of solid obstacles in the fine mesh discretization is a direct way to make numerical calculations on porous objects. However, calculations using the fine mesh increase the computational load and cost a lot of time and money. In order to reduce these factors, we applied space averaging to the Navier-Stokes equations and derived filtered equations with a subgrid scale turbulent modeling for the large eddy simulation (LES). This paper demonstrates how we were able to calculate the space-averaged property of flows with coarse meshes without a heavy computational load. Finally, we also present a numerical calculation for the turbulent field around a windbreak placed on a flat plane and compare the results to a wind tunnel test data. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

At the inlet of the wind tunnel, a “line source” of particles was released, simulating air laden with particulate matter. Experiments with the cypress tree and tree-free models were conducted to compare particle concentrations around the buildings. The results indicate that cypress trees clearly reduce PM2.5concentrations compared with the tree-free model. The cypress trees enhanced the PM2.5removal rate by about 20{\%}. The effects of trees on PM2.5removal and distribution vary at different heights. At the base of the trees, their effect on reducing PM2.5concentrations is the most significant. At a great height above the treetops, the effect is almost negligible.},

abstract = {With the popularization of green roofing systems, their wind resistant performance is becoming more and more important especially in typhoon areas. A prerequisite study was carried out to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of suitable trees to provide basic scientific data. Shrubby specimens of three tree species appropriate for intensive green roofs with different aerodynamic forms were tested through a boundary layer wind tunnel experiment, including one deciduous tree, one coniferous tree and one broadleaf evergreen tree. Drags and overturning moments under different wind speeds were measured; wind-speed-specific frontal areas and tip displacements were recorded. After initial tests, trees were pruned to investigate the effect of crown porosity, and the effects of view angle and turbulence intensity were also considered. The results showed that even considering frontal area reduction due to increasing wind speeds, drag coefficients decreased with increase in wind speed for deciduous and coniferous trees. Drag coefficient characteristics for different trees agreed well with those obtained from previous researches. The effect of crown porosity varied among tree species, but view angle and turbulence intensity did not significantly affect it. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

Taking emotions into account is expected to enhance public engagement. However, how such emotions can be included without them being used merely instrumentally is less straightforward. Art is a more affective form of communication which in its performance can extend the provision of factual information enabling observers to get a feel of what future perspectives could look like. This article aims to explore the potential of bio-art as more affective form of communication for public engagement. Using observations, in- terviews and focus groups amongst visitors of a bio-art exhibition we have found two thematic lines of thought which illustrate how their engagement evolves. These themes provide insight how and with what engagement amongst visitors emerges by observing bio-art. Implications for using art for public engagement are discussed.},

abstract = {Particle image velocimetry measurements have been performed in a solid-liquid fluidized bed in the Reynolds number range 51-759. To do this, the refractive indexes of the solid and liquid phases were matched at approximately 1.47 using 3. mm diameter borosilicate glass beads and a solution of turpentine and tetra-hydronaphthalene. Paraffin oil was added in varying quantities to vary the dynamic viscosity between 0.0012 and 0.010. Pa. s without changing the refractive index of the solution. From the PIV measurements, at sampling rates of 2. Hz, the fluctuating velocity components were found to be quite uniform in both the axial and radial directions. Moreover, the computed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were also found to be relatively constant throughout the bed, thus highlighting the homogenous nature of the turbulence within the system.Following from Reddy et al. (2010b), direct numerical simulations were undertaken at particle Reynolds numbers up to 200 for assemblages of 1, 9, 27, 100, 180 and 245 particles, which corresponded to a liquid volume fraction range of 0.687$\pi$∈L$\pi$0.998. The effect of surrounding particles on the settling velocity (hindrance effect) and the wake dynamics was investigated. It was found that the average settling velocity decreased with an increasing number of particles, with the quantitative results being in good agreement with the well established empirical correlation of Richardson and Zaki (1954). The local energy dissipation rate was also computed, and for a particle Reynolds number of 51, it was found to be 5.5m2s-3. This value was approximately 18 times the average energy dissipation rate of 0.30m2s-3; and compared favourably with the 0.36m2s-3obtained by a volume-averaged energy balance of the experimental system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Entropic lattice Boltzmann methods were introduced to overcome the stability issues of lattice Boltzmann models for high Reynolds number turbulent flows. However, to date their validity has been investigated only for simple flows due to the lack of appropriate boundary conditions. We present here an extension of these models to complex flows involving curved and moving boundaries in three dimensions. Apart from a thorough investigation of resolved and under-resolved simulations for periodic flow and turbulent flow in a round pipe, we study in detail the set-up of a simplified internal combustion engine with a valve/piston arrangement. This arrangement allows us to probe the non-trivial interactions between various flow features such as jet breakup, jet–wall interaction, and formation and breakup of large vortical structures, among others. Besides an order of magnitude reduction in computational costs, when compared to state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNS), these methods come with the additional advantage of using static Cartesian meshes also for moving objects, which reduces the complexity of the scheme. Going beyond first-order statistics, a detailed comparison of mean and root-mean-square velocity profiles with high-order spectral element DNS simulations and experimental data shows excellent agreement, highlighting the accuracy and reliability of the method for resolved simulations. Moreover, we show that the implicit subgrid features of the entropic lattice Boltzmann method can be utilized to further reduce the grid sizes and the computational costs, providing an alternative to modern modelling approaches such as large-eddy simulations for complex flows.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is often used to predict flow structures in urban areas for the determination of pollutant dispersion, human comfort or heat fluxes. During daytime building fa??ades and ground surfaces are heated by solar radiation and thereby induce buoyancy, which changes the flow field around buildings significantly. The CFD models used to simulate buoyant flow fields in urban areas are not sufficiently validated. This study aims to validate CFD simulations for buoyant flows in urban street canyons by comparison with wind tunnel measurements. 2D steady RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) CFD simulations were conducted with different near-wall treatments. Velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and temperature profiles from CFD were compared with the measured flow fields (measurement technique: particle image velocimetry). Isothermal cases as well as cases with leeward wall or windward wall heating or all surfaces heated were considered. The results show that CFD can predict the general flow structures and the influence of buoyancy. The detailed flow field inside the street canyon is strongly dependent on the flow structure within the shear layer at the top of the street canyon. Therefore to get accurate results for the flow profiles inside the street canyon, the flow within the shear layer has to be predicted correctly. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The canonical formof atmospheric flows near the land surface, in the absence of a canopy, resembles a rough-wall boundary layer. However, in the presence of an extensive and dense canopy, the flow within and just above the foliage behaves as a perturbed mixing layer. To date, no analogous formulation exists for intermediate canopy densities. Using detailed laser Doppler velocity meas- urements conducted in an open channel over a wide range of canopy densities, a phenomenological model that describes the structure of turbulence within the canopy sublayer (CSL) is developed. The model decomposes the space within theCSL into three distinct zones: the deep zone in which the flow field is shown to be dominated by vortices connected with vonK{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex streets, but periodically interrupted by strong sweep events whose features are influenced by canopy density. The second zone, which is near the canopy top, is a superposition of attached eddies and Kelvin–Helmholtz waves produced by inflectional instability in themean longitudinal velocity profile. Here, the relative importance of the mixing layer and attached eddies are shown to vary with canopy density through a coefficient $\alpha$.We show that the relative enhancement of turbulent diffusivity over its surface-layer value near the canopy top depends on the magnitude of $\alpha$. In the uppermost zone, the flow follows the classical surface-layer similarity theory. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of this newly proposed length scale and first-order closure models can accurately reproduce measured mean velocity and Reynolds stresses for a wide range of roughness densities.With recent advancement in remote sensing of canopy morphology, this model offers a promising physically based approach to connect the land surface and the atmosphere without resorting to empirical momentum roughness lengths.},

The new model resolves the subfacet heterogeneity of urban surfaces, which is particularly useful for capturing surface exchange processes from vegetated urban surfaces, such as lawns or green roofs. We develop detailed urban hydrological models for surfaces consisting of either natural (soil and vegetation) or engineered materials with water-holding capacity. The coupling of energy and water transport enables us to parametrize surface evaporation from different urban facets including soils, vegetation and water-holding engineered surfaces. The new coupled model is evaluated using field measurement data obtained through a wireless sensor network deployed over the Princeton University campus. Comparison of model prediction and measured results shows that the proposed surface exchange scheme is able to predict widely varying surface temperatures for each subfacet with good accuracy. Different weather conditions and seasonal variability are found to have insignificant effect on the model performance. The new model is also able to capture the subsurface hydrological processes with reasonable accuracy, particularly for urban lawns. The proposed model is then applied to assess different mitigation strategies of the urban heat island effect.},

Therefore characteristic differences between urban and rural climates are outlined within the frames of the given paper. On part 1 an analysis of the urban atmospheric boundary layer structure, modifications of the urban radiation and energy balance are discussed. In addition to the characteristics of the urban heat island effect and urban air quality, the impact of built-up areas on atmospheric humidity, precipitation and fog are reviewed. In part 2 methods for illustration and evaluation of urban climatic effects, as well as tasks for meliorating the urban climate are considered. The article ends with a prospect on future changes in urban climate modifications caused by global climatic changes which are predicted by model simulations.

Theoretical development of this model yields a combination equation which describes evaporation in terms of controlling resistances associated with the plants, and with the soil or water in which they are growing. the equation provides a simple but physically plausible description of the transition between bare substrate and a closed canopy. Although the aerodynamic transfer resistances for incomplete canopies have, as yet, no experimental justification, typical values, appropriate to a specimen agricultural crop and soil, are shown to have limited sensitivity in the model. Processes which require further study if the equation is to be used to calculate evaporation throughout a crop season are also discussed.},

abstract = {1. Quantification of stomatal responses to environmental variables, in particular to soil water status, is needed to model carbon and water exchange rates between plants and the atmosphere.2. Models based on stomatal optimality theory successfully describe leaf gas exchange under different environmental conditions, but the effects of water availability on the key optimization parameter [the marginal water use efficiency (WUE), $\lambda$ = ∂A/∂E] has resisted complete theoretical treatment. Building on previous optimal leaf gas exchange models, we developed an analytical equation to estimate $\lambda$ from gas exchange observations along gradients of soil water availability. This expression was then used in a meta-analysis of about 50 species to investigate patterns of variation in $\lambda$.3. Assuming that cuticular water losses are negligible $\lambda$ increases under mild water stress but decreases when severe water stress limits photosynthesis. When cuticular conductance is considered, however, $\lambda$ increases monotonically with increasing water stress, in agreement with previous theoretical predictions. Moreover, the shape of these response curves to soil water availability changes with plant functional type and climatic conditions. In general, $\lambda$ is lower in species grown in dry climates, indicating lower marginal WUE.4. The proposed parameterization provides a framework to assess the responses of leaf gas exchange to changes in water availability. Moreover, the model can be extended to scale leaf-level fluxes to the canopy and ecosystem level.},

Consequences range from a poor signal-to-noise ratio (overexposure) in near-surface areas up to camera sensor damage. The severity depends on the interplay between three factors: surface properties, laser light intensity and relative camera position. In stereoscopic or tomographic PIV setups, material selection is often the only factor which can be adapted. We present a systematic comparative study, involving different materials and surface treatments. Their potential to mitigate surface reflections is quantified against the reference case of a flat black painted wooden surface. The largest reduction of surface reflection intensity is obtained by applying fluorescent paint on wood or by employing electropolished steel. The more widely used flat black painted wood shows poor behavior. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been argued that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The extreme high temperatures of the summer of 2003 were associated with up to seventy thousand excess deaths across Europe. Previous studies have attributed the meteorological event to the human influence on climate, or examined the role of heat waves on human health. Here, for the first time, we explicitly quantify the role of human activity on climate and heat-related mortality in an event attribution framework, analysing both the Europe-wide temperature response in 2003, and localised responses over London and Paris. Using publicly-donated computing, we perform many thousands of climate simulations of a high-resolution regional climate model. This allows generation of a comprehensive statistical description of the 2003 event and the role of human influence within it, using the results as input to a health impact assessment model of human mortality. We find large-scale dynamical modes of atmospheric variability remain largely unchanged under anthropogenic climate change, and hence the direct thermodynamical response is mainly responsible for the increased mortality. In summer 2003, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat-related mortality in Central Paris by ∼70{\%} and by ∼20{\%} in London, which experienced lower extreme heat. Out of the estimated ∼315 and ∼735 summer deaths attributed to the heatwave event in Greater London and Central Paris, respectively, 64 (±3) deaths were attributable to anthropogenic climate change in London, and 506 (±51) in Paris. Such an ability to robustly attribute specific damages to anthropogenic drivers of increased extreme heat can inform societal responses to, and responsibilities for, climate change.},

abstract = {Understanding photosynthesis and plant water management as a coupled process remains an open scientific problem. Current eco-hydrologic models characteristically describe plant photosynthetic and hydraulic processes through ad hoc empirical parameterizations with no explicit accounting for the main pathways over which carbon and water uptake interact. Here, a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model is proposed that mechanistically couples photosynthesis and transpiration rates, including the main leaf physiological controls exerted by stomata. The proposed approach links the soil-to-leaf hydraulic transport to stomatal regulation, and closes the coupled photosynthesis-transpiration problem by maximizing leaf carbon gain subject to a water loss constraint. The approach is evaluated against field data from a grass site and is shown to reproduce the main features of soil moisture dynamics and hydraulic redistribution. In particular, it is shown that the differential soil drying produced by diurnal root water uptake drives a significant upward redistribution of moisture both through a conventional Darcian flow and through the root system, consistent with observations. In a numerical soil drying experiment, it is demonstrated that more than 50{\%} of diurnal transpiration is supplied by nocturnal upward water redistribution, and some 12{\%} is provided directly through root hydraulic redistribution. For a prescribed leaf area density, the model is then used to diagnose how elevated atmospheric CO2concentration and increased air temperature jointly impact soil moisture, transpiration, photosynthesis, and whole-plant water use efficiency, along with compensatory mechanisms such as hydraulic lift using several canonical forms of root-density distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The assessment of the thermal environment is one of the main issues in bioclimatic research, and more than 100 simple bioclimatic indices have thus far been developed to facilitate it. However, most of these indices have proved to be of limited applicability, and do not portray the actual impacts of thermal conditions on human beings. Indices derived from human heatbalance models (one- or two-node) have been found to offer a better representation of the environmental impact in question than do simple ones. Indeed, the new generation of multi-node models for human heat balance do allow full account to be taken of heat transfer and exchange, both within the human body and between the body surface and the surrounding air layer. In this paper, it is essential background information regarding the newly-developed Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI that is presented, this in fact deriving from the Fiala multi-node model of human heatbalance. The UTCI is defined as the air temperature (Ta) of the reference condition causing the same model response as actual conditions. UTCI was developed in 2009 by virtue of international co-operation between leading experts in the areas of human thermophysiology, physiological modelling, meteorology and climatology. The necessary research for this had been conducted within the framework of a special commission of the International Society of Biometeorology (ISB) and European COST Action 730.},

abstract = {The European Mediterranean regions are expected to encounter drier summer conditions and warmer temperatures for the winter of +2°C and of +5°C for the summer in the next six decennia. As a result the natural vegetation will face harsher conditions due to lower water availability, longer summer droughts and higher temperatures resulting in plant stress conditions. To monitor vegetation conditions like stress and leaf area index dynamics in our study area in Mediterranean France we use earth observation techniques like imaging spectroscopy. To assist image analysis interpretation we carried out a laboratory experiment to investigate the spectral and visible response of Buxus sempervirens, a common Mediterranean species, to five different types of stress: drought, drought-and-heat, light deprivation, total saturation and chlorine poisoning. For 52days plants were subjected to stress. We collected data on the visible and spectral signs, and calculated thirteen vegetation indices. The plant's response time to different stress types varied from 10 to 32days. Spectroscopic techniques revealed plant stress up to 15days earlier than visual inspection. Visible signs of stress of the plants included curling and shrinking of the leaves, de-colouring of the leaves, leaves becoming breakable, opening up of the plant's canopy and sagging of the branches. Spectral signs of stress occurred first in the water absorption bands at 1450 and 1940nm, followed by reduced absorption in the visible wavelengths, and next by reduced reflectance in near infrared. Light deprivation did not result in any stress signs, while drought, drought and heat and chlorine poisoning resulted in significant stress. The spectral response did not show differences for different stress types. Analysis of the vegetation indices identified the Carter-2 (R695/R760), the Red-Green Index (R690/R550) and the Vogelman-2 (R734-R747)/(R715+R726) as the best performing ones to identify stress. The lab experiment shows that spectroscopic techniques are useful to detect stress status of plants and in an earlier stage than visible signs of stress become apparent, but that spectroscopy does not reveal the type of plant stress. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

@article{Paniconi1994,
abstract = {Picard iteration is a widely used procedure for solving the nonlinear equation governing flow in variably saturated porous media. The method is simple to code and computationally cheap, but has been known to fail or converge slowly. The Newton method is more complex and expensive (on a per-iteration basis) than Picard, and as such has not received very much attention. Its robustness and higher rate of convergence, however, make it an attractive alternative to the Picard method, particularly for strongly nonlinear problems. In this paper the Picard and Newton schemes are implemented and compared in one-, two-, and three-dimensional finite element simulations involving both steady state and transient flow. The eight test cases presented highlight different aspects of the performance of the two iterative methods and the different factors that can affect their convergence and efficiency, including problem size, spatial and temporal discretization, initial solution estimates, convergence error norm, mass lureping, time weighting, conductivity and moisture content characteristics, boundary conditions, seepage faces, and the extent of fully satarated zones in the soft. Previous strategies for enhancing the performance of the heard and Newton schemes are revisited, and new ones are suggested. The strategies include chord slope approximations for the derivatives of the characteristic equations, relaxing convergence requirements along seepage faces, dynamic time step control, nonlinear relaxation, and a mixed Picard-Newton approach. The tests show that the Picard or relaxed Picard schemes are often adequate for solving Richards' equation, but that in cases where these fail to converge or converge slowly, the Newton method should be used. The mixed Picard-Newton approach can effectively overcome the Newton scheme's sensitivity to initial solution estimates, while comparatively poor performance is reported for the various chord slope approximations. Finally, given the reliability and efficiency of current conjugate gradient-like methods for solving linear nonsymmetric systems, the only real drawback of using Newton rather than Picard iteration is the algebraic complexity and computational cost of assembling the derivative terms of the JacobJan matrix, and it is suggested that both methods can be effectively implemented and used in numerical models of Richards' equation},

Numerous examples are provided to illustrate many of the principles, and problems are included at the end of each chapter to help the student develop skills in using the equations and to gain an understanding of modern environmental biophysics. The book is an engineering approach to environmental biology.},

abstract = {Vegetation can provide transpirative cooling in cities and is therefore being increasingly integrated as an essential part of Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation strategies. However, the behaviour of vegetation must be accurately understood to determine the effectiveness of vegetation based solutions. In this study, vegetation is modelled as a porous medium in a computational fluid dynamics model for flow of moist air, where a leaf energy balance model is used to determine the heat fluxes. We study the cooling effect of a single row of trees at noon with solar altitude at 90° for various environmental factors (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation intensity) and tree properties (leaf size, stomatal resistance and leaf area density). Furthermore, the influence of tree height and number of tree rows on the cooling effect are studied. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) around the trees is estimated to determine the impact of transpirative cooling on pedestrian thermal comfort. The study shows that, at low wind speeds, pedestrians would only perceive a local benefit of transpirative cooling. However, vegetation extracts overall more heat from the flow at higher wind speeds. A study on the influence of environmental conditions quantifies to which extent a single row of trees provide maximum cooling during hot and dry conditions. The shading provided by trees improves thermal comfort more that transpirative cooling of a single row of trees. Furthermore, taller trees are more beneficial as the vegetation canopy with high leaf temperatures is further away from the pedestrian level.},

abstract = {In December of 2015, the international community pledged to limit global warming to below 2 °C above preindustrial (PI) to prevent dangerous climate change. However, to what extent, and for whom, is danger avoided if this ambitious target is realized? We address these questions by scrutinizing heat stress, because the frequency of extremely hot weather is expected to continue to rise in the approach to the 2 °C limit. We use analogs and the extreme South Asian heat of 2015 as a focusing event to help interpret the increasing frequency of deadly heat under specified amounts of global warming. Using a large ensemble of climate models, our results confirm that global mean air temperature is nonlinearly related to heat stress, meaning that the same future warming as realized to date could trigger larger increases in societal impacts than historically experienced. This nonlinearity is higher for heat stress metrics that integrate the effect of rising humidity. We show that, even in a climate held to 2 °C above PI, Karachi (Pakistan) and Kolkata (India) could expect conditions equivalent to their deadly 2015 heatwaves every year. With only 1.5 °C of global warming, twice as many megacities (such as Lagos, Nigeria, and Shanghai, China) could become heat stressed, exposing more than 350 million more people to deadly heat by 2050 under a midrange population growth scenario. The results underscore that, even if the Paris targets are realized, there could still be a significant adaptation imperative for vulnerable urban populations.},

The aim of this study is to highlight the fundamental differences between nominally two-dimensional and fully three-dimensional obstacle flows. All experiments were performed in a fully developed channel flow. The Reynolds number, based on the height of the channel, lay between 8 x 104 and 1.2 x JO5. Results show that the middle region of the wake is nominally two-dimensional for width-to-height ratios (W/H) greater than 6. The separated region in front of wider obstacles is characterized by the appearance of a quasi-regular distribution of saddle and nodal points on the forward face of the obstacles. These three-dimensional effects are considered to be inherent to such separating flows with stagnation. 1},

abstract = {An accurate understanding of the dehydration kinetics of biological materials is essential to optimize their dehydration processes and to produce high-quality dried products. For a soft, cellular material like fruit, the underlying mass transport and deformation mechanisms at the cellular scale play a key role here. To improve our insight into the cellular scale dehydration kinetics, a 3D model is developed to quantify the impact of the changes in the cellular structure of apple (parenchyma) cells during dehydration on the tissue sorption isotherm and water permeability. As a step beyond the current state-of-the-art models, the model incorporates the changes in the cellular structure over entire dehydration process, starting from a turgid cell down to the occurrence of (free) shrinkage, plasmolysis (detachment of the cell membrane from the cell wall) or lysis (rupture of the cell membrane). Regarding the tissue sorption isotherm, plasmolysis induced a reduction in the equilibrium water content (up to 60{\%}) compared to the free-shrinkage or lysis cases at the same water activity level. On the other hand, the tissue water permeability was found to increase up to five times when lysis occurs, compared to free shrinkage or plasmolysis. A parametric study also quantified the dependency of tissue permeability on the cell wall thickness, the cell membrane permeability, the cell size and the elongation aspect ratio of the cell. We identified that the dehydrated, shrunken cellular tissue reduces the outgoing water flux compared to fresh tissue for the same water potential gradient. As such, dehydrated tissue forms a barrier against further moisture removal from the fresh tissue below.},

abstract = {A particle image velocimetry system capable of accurately recovering the out-of-plane velocity component has been realized based on a stereoscopic viewing arrangement. To allow a large viewing angle with long focal length objective lenses, the angular displacement or Scheimpflug imaging configuration is employed in which the image, object and lens planes intersect in a common line. The varying magnification factor associated with this imaging configuration is accounted for using an accurate and simple-to-use calibration procedure based on solving the projection equations for each of the two cameras. A pair of high-resolution cameras, both capable of recording image pairs in the microsecond range, are synchronized to a pulsed Nd-YAG laser. By placing the cameras on either side of the light sheet the favourable light scattering characteristics of micron-sized seeding particles in forward scatter provide images at significantly higher illumination than at normal or backscatter viewing angles. Ultimately designed for use in industrial wind tunnels, the camera system is capable of working with non-symmetric arrangements. It has been successfully tested in a laboratory environment by imaging the unsteady flow field of a vortex ring passing through a laser light sheet. Adaptive processing software capable of dynamically adjusting the sample location of the interrogation windows to the local displacement vector significantly improves data yield. The algorithm requires only the selection of the final window/overlap size. The hierarchical interrogation approach permits the processing of images whose displacement dynamic range exceeds the interrogation window size.},

@article{McVicar2012,
abstract = {In a globally warming climate, observed rates of atmospheric evaporative demand have declined over recent decades. Several recent studies have shown that declining rates of evaporative demand are primarily governed by trends in the aerodynamic component (primarily being the combination of the effects of wind speed (u) and atmospheric humidity) and secondarily by changes in the radiative component. A number of these studies also show that declining rates of observed near-surface u (termed 'stilling') is the primary factor contributing to declining rates of evaporative demand. One objective of this paper was to review and synthesise the literature to assess whether stilling is a globally widespread phenomenon. We analysed 148 studies reporting terrestrial u trends from across the globe (with uneven and incomplete spatial distribution and differing periods of measurement) and found that the average trend was -0.014ms-1a-1for studies with more than 30 sites observing data for more than 30years, which confirmed that stilling was widespread. Assuming a linear trend this constitutes a -0.7ms-1change in u over 50years. A second objective was to confirm the declining rates of evaporative demand by reviewing papers reporting trends in measured pan evaporation (Epan) and estimated crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo); average trends were -3.19mma-2(n=55) and -1.31mma-2(n=26), respectively. A third objective was to assess the contribution to evaporative demand trends that the four primary meteorological variables (being u; atmospheric humidity; radiation; and air temperature) made. The results from 36 studies highlighted the importance of u trends. We also quantified the sensitivity of rates of evaporative demand to changes in u and how the relative contributions of the aerodynamic and radiative components change seasonally over the globe. Our review: (i) shows that terrestrial stilling is widespread across the globe; (ii) confirms declining rates of evaporative demand; and (iii) highlights the contribution u has made to these declining evaporative rates. Hence we advocate that assessing evaporative demand trends requires consideration of all four primary meteorological variables (being u, atmospheric humidity, radiation and air temperature). This is particularly relevant for long-term water resource assessment because changes in u exert greater influence on energy-limited water-yielding catchments than water-limited ones. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Competition for water among multiple tree rooting systems is investigated using a soil–plant model that accounts for soil moisture dynamics and root water uptake (RWU), whole plant transpiration, and leaf- level photosynthesis. The model is based on a numerical solution to the 3D Richards equation modified to account for a 3D RWU, trunk xylem, and stomatal conductances. The stomatal conductance is deter- mined by combining a conventional biochemical demand formulation for photosynthesis with an optimi- zation hypothesis that selects stomatal aperture so as to maximize carbon gain for a given water loss. Model results compare well with measurements of soil moisture throughout the rooting zone, of total sap flow in the trunk xylem, as well as of leaf water potential collected in a Loblolly pine forest. The model is then used to diagnose plant responses to water stress in the presence of competing rooting systems. Unsurprisingly, the overlap between rooting zones is shown to enhance soil drying. However, the 3D spa- tial model yielded transpiration-bulk root-zone soil moisture relations that do not deviate appreciably from their proto-typical form commonly assumed in lumped eco-hydrological models. The increased overlap among rooting systems primarily alters the timing at which the point of incipient soil moisture stress is reached by the entire soil–plant system.},

It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos and emissivlties, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer.},

These obstacles were fabricated using a specialty superabsorbent hydrogel produced through the free-radical copolymerization of sodium acrylate and acrylamide. The optical properties of this gel were found to be nearly identical to those of liquid water. Because of refractive index matching (RIM) of both the fluid and solid media, PIV laser light sheets passed through the obstructions without significant degradation or modification. As a result, all tracer particles suspended in the flow were uniformly illuminated, regardless of their position or proximity relative to individual obstacle features. PIV light sheets were also successfully imaged through the hydrogel, enabling accurate velocity measurement in regions that would otherwise be optically inaccessible. These outcomes were reached without reliance on unconventional fluids or specialized flow facilities. For many experimenters interested in fluid-solid interactions, hydrogel-based RIM may thus be less costly and more adaptable than methods that rely on the existing suite of techniques.},

abstract = {In the tropics, the main constraints of crop production in the open field are extreme solar radiation, high rainfall, insects and diseases. Naturally ventilated tropical crop protection structures were developed to address the constraints. Basically, the structure consists of a simple structural frame, a transparent polyethylene roofing and an insect screen sidewall. This paper presents the comparison between two types of greenhouse structures in terms of in-house microclimate that is very important for plant growth. The environmental parameters involved are air temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, wind speed and carbon dioxide concentration. The naturally ventilated crop protection structures are Tunnel-Roof and Jack-Roof at Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI), Serdang. Tunnel-Roof has sidewall open vents, while Jack-Roof has sidewall and roof open vents as natural ventilators. The average maximum temperature between outside and inside was recorded as 6.57C and 3.35C for Tunnel-Roof and Jack-Roof respectively. The lowest average relative humidity was recorded as 56.98{\%}, 41.10{\%} and 51.13{\%} for the outside structure, inside Tunnel-Roof structure and inside Jack-Roof structure respectively. The difference between two inside structures was shown as 10.03{\%}. The highest value of average wind speed was recorded as 1.39 m s-1 for the outside structure at 14:00 pm, while for the inside structure (Jack-Roof) it was recorded as 0.4 m s-1. The lowest light intensity was recorded at 8:00 am among eleven sessions from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. The average range value of carbon dioxide concentration in the air is 420 to 500 ppm for the inside Jack-Roof structure and 390 to 490 ppm for the outside structure.},

abstract = {Computer representations of plants (virtual plants) are used as the basis for a model simulating leaf transpiration and sap flow. The virtual plants provide a detailed description of plant geometry and topology and, once positioned in a scene, enable a highly realistic reconstruction of a portion of the canopy. Stomatal conductance as well as energy balance are simulated by the model at the level of individual leaves in order to calculate their transpiration. Leaf transpiration is then cumulated to get the sap flow throughout the plant. Owing to its structure, the model can take into account feedbacks such as the effect of the temperature of a leaf on its stomatal conductance, transpiration and water potential, and in return, the effect of water potential of a leaf on its stomatal conductance. The model has been validated on a coffee tree stand in Costa Rica. The geometry (i.e. 3D position, area and diameter of organs) of six adult coffee trees in a row was measured in the field in order to generate a computer scene. Stomatal conductance, sap flow, water potential and wood hydraulic conductivity were measured for model parameterisation and validation. Analysis of model outputs lead to a correction of leaf boundary layer thickness. After calibration, the model exhibited correct values of transpiration and water potential in different microclimatic conditions.},

abstract = {Porosity is the most important parameter that determines the efficiency of wind fences. The present study provided a deeper understanding of mean flow regime behind fences with different porosities at different wind velocities by means of a scaled wind tunnel simulation. Velocities were measured using particle image velocimetry and the mean velocity field was obtained and discussed. The mean velocity fields obtained at different wind velocities were similar. Analyzing the streamline patterns revealed an inherent link between fence porosity and mean airflow characteristics behind the fence. The optimal fence porosity is considered to be the critical porosity above or below which airflow characteristics differ strongly. According to the present study, the optimal porosity is found to be around 0.2 or 0.3, which corresponds to a critical porosity above which bleed flow dominates and below which reversed flow becomes significant. The parameters characterizing the reverse cell behind fences were well correlated with porosity. The velocity profiles revealed seven typical flow regions behind fences, characterized by different velocity gradients. The airflow becomes less complicated and the number of flow regions decreases as fence porosity increases. Some regions, especially the reverse cell and small vortex, disappear when the porosity exceeds a certain value. The flow regions gradually merge as the distance downwind increases, and eventually recover a single velocity profile due to downward transfer of momentum from overlying layers. The recovery distance decreases with increasing fence porosity. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

* In addition to buffering plants from water stress during severe droughts, plant water storage (PWS) alters many features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil–plant system. How PWS impacts water dynamics and drought resilience is explored using a multi-layer porous media model.


* The model numerically resolves soil–plant hydrodynamics by coupling them to leaf-level gas exchange and soil–root interfacial layers. Novel features of the model are the considerations of a coordinated relationship between stomatal aperture variation and whole-system hydraulics and of the effects of PWS and nocturnal transpiration (Fe,night) on hydraulic redistribution (HR) in the soil.


* The model results suggest that daytime PWS usage and Fe,night generate a residual water potential gradient ($\Delta$$\psi$p,night) along the plant vascular system overnight. This $\Delta$$\psi$p,night represents a non-negligible competing sink strength that diminishes the significance of HR.


* Considering the co-occurrence of PWS usage and HR during a single extended dry-down, a wide range of plant attributes and environmental/soil conditions selected to enhance or suppress plant drought resilience is discussed. When compared with HR, model calculations suggest that increased root water influx into plant conducting-tissues overnight maintains a more favorable water status at the leaf, thereby delaying the onset of drought stress.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The DART (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer) model simulates radiative transfer in heterogeneous 3-D scenes that may comprise different landscape features; i.e., leaves, grass, trunks, water, soil. The scene is divided into a rectangular cell matrix, i.e., building block for simulating larger scenes. Cells are parallelipipedic. Their optical properties are represented by individual scattering phase functions that are directly input into the model or are computed with optical and structural characteristics of elements within the cell. Radiation scattering and propagation are simulated with the exact kernel and discrete ordinate approaches; any set of discrete direction can be selected. In addition to topography and hot spot, leaf specular and first-order polarization mechanisms are modeled. Two major iterative steps are distinguished: 1) Cell illumination with direct sun radiation: Within cell multiple scattering is accurately simulated. 2) Interception and scattering of previously scattered radiation: Atmospheric radiation, possibly anisotropic, is input at this stage. Multiple scattering is stored as spherical harmonics expansions, for reducing computer memory constraints. The model iterates on step 2, for all cells, and stops with the energetic equilibrium. Two simple accelerating techniques can be used: 1) Gauss Seidel method, i.e., simulation of scattering with radiation already scattered at the iteration stage, and (2) decrease of the spherical harmonics expansion order with the iteration order. Moreover, convergence towards the energetic equilibrium is accelerated with an exponential fitting technique. This model predicts the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of 3- D canopies. Radiation components associated with leaf volume and surface mechanisms are distinguished. It gives also the radiation regime within canopies, for further determination of 3-D photosynthesis rates and primary production. Accurate modeling of multiple scattering within cells, combined with the fact that cells can have different x,y,z dimensions, is well adapted to remote sensing based studies, i.e., scenes with large dimensions. The model was successfully tested with homogeneous covers. Preliminary comparisons of simulated reflectance images with remotely acquired spectral images of a 3-D heterogeneous forest cover stressed the usefulness of the DART model for conducting studies with remotely acquired information.},

abstract = {Most transpiration studies of greenhouse crops have been undertaken under cool conditions in northern and central Europe. These conditions are greatly exceeded in most greenhouses of the Mediterranean basin or in other zones where the climate is warmer. This article presents some measured transpiration data of Geranium, Pelargonium zonale grown under high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) (up to 3.4kPa) and temperature (up to 36°C). Calculated transpiration values from the Penman–Monteith equation averaged over 30min intervals were compared with measured transpiration by weighing plant on an electronic balance. To calculate the energy used in transpiration, the radiation term of the Penman–Monteith equation was set equal to the net radiation above the plant canopy times (1−exp(kL)), where k is the extinction coefficient and L is the leaf area index. The best correlation was obtained for k=0.61 (R2=0.93). Leaf resistance was estimated as a function only of solar radiation, since leaf resistance derived from porometer measurements showed no dependence on VPD or temperature. The agreement between measured and calculated transpiration was good for the wide range of temperature, radiation and humidity levels that occurred during the 42 days of the test. The effect of air humidity and temperature on canopy resistance was estimated from measurements of crop water use by rearranging the Penman equation. No reduction of canopy resistance was found for VPD values from 1.4 to 3.4kPa and ambient temperature from 26 to 36°C. A simplified model of daytime transpiration based on easily measured variables is also presented.},

In its present time formulation, this hypothesis corresponds to an alignment between the Reynolds stress and mean strain tensors. We begin with historical remarks on Boussinesq's results and recall that he introduced a local averaging twenty years before Reynolds, but using an approach that prevented him from discovering Reynolds' stress tensor. We then introduce an indicator that characterizes the validity of this hypothesis. For experimental and numerical databases, when the tensors are known, this can be used to directly estimate the validity of this hypothesis. We show, using several different databases, that this hypothesis is almost never verified.

abstract = {The urban microclimate is due to complex physical interactions with the contribution of water balance, thermo-radiative exchanges and airflows. In this paper, we present and discuss modeling of heat island effects and mitigation techniques in order to give consistent results considering different time and space scales, and different fluxes (heat, water and winds) from ground to urban canopy, including buildings. The models and numerical descriptions are presented in detail and illustrated on typical examples of heat island mitigation techniques. At the neighborhood scale, alternative rainwater management techniques are studied by considering their impact on both seasonal water table depth and surface-atmosphere heat fluxes. Assessing the building thermal performance interactions with the microclimate requires adapted models that have to be refined for a better description of building envelope and systems effects. Two examples at the street and the neighborhood scale, modifying the building radiative properties or using green envelopes, show how simulation brings out the potential benefits of these techniques for the heat island mitigation and building energy performance.},

abstract = {Forced-air cooling (FAC) is a widely applied postharvest technology to rapidly remove the field heat of packed fresh fruit. The cooling uniformity of the fruit in different pallets and cartons during FAC is critical but often remains unknown in commercial operations. This study investigated the cooling rate and heterogeneity of packed citrus fruit in a full-scale, forced-air precooler with 40 pallets of fruit. The influence of package design (package type and wrapping) and fruit size on the precooling performance was quantified in several experiments with three types of citrus fruits (‘Navel' orange fruit, ‘Nova' mandarin fruit and ‘Eureka' lemon fruit). Results showed that the cooling heterogeneity mainly occurred along the flow direction. Cooling was uniform between horizontal regions at the same side of the pallets and between the different heights in the precooler. High resolution measurements with 25–30 sensors in a single pallet gave an even better insight in this heterogeneity. Fruit wrapping induced a much slower cooling rate and larger cooling heterogeneity, especially in the cartons at the outflow side of the pallet. The ‘Nova' mandarin fruit in Opentop cartons cooled 24{\%} (at the inflow side of the pallet) and 42{\%} (at the outflow side of the pallet) faster than the ‘Eureka' lemon fruit with similar fruit size in Supervent cartons, showing the impact of packaging design. These experiments quantified the cooling heterogeneity of the commercial precoolers.},

abstract = {Competition for water among multiple tree rooting systems is investigated using a soil-plant model that accounts for soil moisture dynamics and root water uptake (RWU), whole plant transpiration, and leaf-level photosynthesis. The model is based on a numerical solution to the 3D Richards equation modified to account for a 3D RWU, trunk xylem, and stomatal conductances. The stomatal conductance is determined by combining a conventional biochemical demand formulation for photosynthesis with an optimization hypothesis that selects stomatal aperture so as to maximize carbon gain for a given water loss. Model results compare well with measurements of soil moisture throughout the rooting zone, of total sap flow in the trunk xylem, as well as of leaf water potential collected in a Loblolly pine forest. The model is then used to diagnose plant responses to water stress in the presence of competing rooting systems. Unsurprisingly, the overlap between rooting zones is shown to enhance soil drying. However, the 3D spatial model yielded transpiration-bulk root-zone soil moisture relations that do not deviate appreciably from their proto-typical form commonly assumed in lumped eco-hydrological models. The increased overlap among rooting systems primarily alters the timing at which the point of incipient soil moisture stress is reached by the entire soil-plant system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two entirely new chapters were devoted to the coupling of LES with multiresolution multidomain techniques and to the new hybrid approaches that relate the LES procedures to the classical statistical methods based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This 3rd edition adds various sections to the text like a careful error analysis, on filtered density function models and multiscale models. It also contains two new chapters on the prediction of scalars using LES which are of considerable interest for engineering and geophysical modeling.

abstract = {Tree-planting is one of the veritable tools for combating urban heat island and improving thermal comfort in the wake of global warming and urbanization. However, trees of different species and morphological properties have variable solar attenuation capacity and consequently, thermal comfort regulation potential. Besides, the shadow-cast effect by buildings helps in reducing pedestrian radiant load and consequently improves thermal comfort especially in high-density cities even though ventilation is reduced. Therefore, a holistic and contextual understanding of tree-planting and shadow-casting can help in designing climate-proof cities. In this study, we employed the ENVI-met model to better understand the interaction between these two forms of shading (trees and buildings) on the pedestrians' thermal comfort in Hong Kong and the influence of one over the other. The impact of different urban densities on the thermal comfort improvement potential by eight (8) common tree-species in Hong Kong was specifically studied. Results show that shallow canyons are susceptible to worse thermal condition when compared to their deeper counterparts with similar aspect ratio value. Of all tree configuration parameters, leaf area index, tree height and trunk height are most influential in improving and aggravating daytime and nighttime thermal comfort, respectively. We also found that trees' effectiveness in improving daytime thermal comfort reduces with increasing urban density and vice-versa for nighttime. For the reference of planners and landscape architects, this study recommends tall trees of low canopy density with high trunk in deeper canyons and vice-versa for shallow canyons and open-areas.},

Mean vertical profiles of wind velocity derived from the output are realistic in their shape and response to forest density. Similarly, vertical profiles of Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy and velocity skewness match observations, at least in a qualitative sense. The limited vertical extent of the domain and the artificial upper boundary, however, cause some departures from measured turbulence profiles in real forests. Instantaneous turbulent velocity and scalar fields are presented which show some of the features obtained by tower instrumentation in the field and in wind tunnels, such as the vertical coherence of vertical velocity and the slope of structures revealed by temperature patterns.},

abstract = {The study of urban phenology is relevant to assess the effects of heat islands and the potential impacts of climate change on plants. Temperature is the main factor regulating plant development in moist/temperate regions. However, plants in tropical cities may respond to additional environmental cues, such as air humidity. We examined whether differences in air temperature and humidity along an urban-rural gradient influenced phenological onset dates of trees in a temperate mid-latitude city (Munich, Germany) and a city in the neotropics (Campinas, Brazil). (Dis)similarities were identified incorporating equivalent study design based on identical methods for recording phenology and site-specific meteorological data. We found that phenological onset dates of silver birch (Betula pendula) were able to describe local temperature variations in Munich. Correlation coefficients between mean temperature and onset dates of Betula were significant and varied between r=-0.48 and r=-0.72. However, onset dates for yellow trumpet tree (Tabebuia chrysotricha), false Brazilwood (Caesalpinia pluviosa) and rosewood (Tipuana tipu) in Campinas were rather variable, and the magnitude and significance of correlation coefficients with temperature varied greatly among species/phenophases. Nevertheless, we detected significant correlations, especially between Tipuana phenophases and temperature and between leaf unfolding of Tabebuia and humidity. Our findings revealed that the phenology of Tipuana was sufficiently sensitive to detect urban heat island effects in Campinas and might be a useful indicator of temperature variations and, in turn, of global warming. Because Tipuana is widely used for urban arborization in South America, we foresee many applications for monitoring heat islands in the neotropics. Furthermore, the fact that most phenophases of Tabebuia were not responsive to temperature stressed the importance of humidity variables. Additional species and phenophases should be explored to identify the further potential of phenology for monitoring heat islands in tropical cities.},

The index of thermal stress was calculated hourly from measured meteorological data in the studied sites to evaluate thermal comfort in the different spaces based on radiative and convective pedestrian–environment energy exchanges and sweat efficiency, and expressed on a thermal sensation scale ranging from ‘comfortable' to ‘very hot'. The efficiency of water use in providing improved comfort was gauged for each of the vegetative landscaping treatments by comparing the total evapotranspiration with the reduction in thermal stress, both expressed in terms of their values in equivalent energy. While conditions in a paved, unshaded courtyard were found to be uncomfortable throughout the daytime hours (with half of these hours defined by severe discomfort), each of the landscape treatments made a clear contribution to improved thermal comfort. With shading, either by trees or mesh, discomfort was reduced in duration by over half and limited in maximum severity when the shading was placed above paving. When combined with grass, both shading mechanisms yielded comfortable conditions at all hours. In both cases, the effect of trees was more pronounced than that of the mesh, but by a small margin. With unshaded grass, ‘hot' conditions in the courtyard were restricted to a short period in mid-afternoon, a considerable improvement over unshaded paving, attributable mainly to the lower radiant surface temperatures.},

abstract = {In order to study the turbulence structure behind a multiscale tree-like element in a boundary layer, detailed particle image velocimetry measurements are carried out in the near-wake of a fractal-like tree. The tree is a pre-fractal with five generations, each consisting of three branches and a scale-reduction factor of 1/2 between consecutive generations. Detailed mean velocity and turbulence stress profiles are documented, as well as their downstream development. Scatter plots of mean velocity gradient (transverse shear in the wake) and Reynolds shear stress exhibit a good linear relation at all locations in the flow. Therefore, in the transverse direction of the wake evolution, the data support the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity concept. The measured mixing length increases with streamwise distance, in agreement with classic wake expansion rates. Conversely, the measured eddy viscosity and mixing length in the transverse direction decrease with increasing elevation, which differs from the behaviours measured in the vertical direction in traditional boundary layers or in canopy flows studied before. In order to find an appropriate single length scale to describe the wake evolution behind a multiscale object, two models are proposed, based on the notion of superposition of scales. One approach is based on the radial spectrum of the object while the second is based on its length-scale distribution evaluated using fractal geometry tools. Both proposed models agree well with the measured mixing length. The results suggest that information about multiscale clustering of branches must be incorporated into models of the mixing length for flows through single or sparse canopies of multiscale trees.},

abstract = {The aim of the present investigation is evaluation of the thermophysical and transport properties of moist air as a function of mixture temperature with relative humidity as a parameter, ranging between dry air and saturation conditions. Based on a literature review of the most widely available analytical procedures and methods, a number of developed correlations are presented, which are employed with recent gas mixture component properties as input parameters, to derive the temperature and humidity dependence of mixture density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and Prandtl number under conditions corresponding to the total barometric pressure of 101.3 kPa. The derived results at an accuracy level suitable for engineering calculations were plotted and compared with adequate accuracy with existing results from previous analytical calculations and measured data from earlier experimental investigations. The saturated mixture properties were also appropriately fitted, and the fitting expressions suitable for computer calculations are also presented. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Four commonly used refractive-index (RI)-matched Newtonian blood-analog fluids are reviewed, and different non-Newtonian blood-analogs, with RI of 1.372--1.495, are investigated. Sodium iodide (NaI), sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) and potassium thiocyanate are used to adjust the RI of blood-analogs to that of test sections for minimizing optical distortions in particle image velocimetry data, and xanthan gum (XG) is added to the fluids to give them non-Newtonian properties (shear thinning and viscoelasticity). Our results support the general belief that adding NaI to Newtonian fluids matches the RI without changing the kinematic viscosity. However, in contrast to claims made in a few studies that did not measure rheology, our investigation revealed that adding NaI or NaSCN to XG-based non-Newtonian fluids changes the viscosity of the fluids considerably and reduces the shear-thinning property. Therefore, the RI of non-Newtonian blood-analog fluids with XG cannot be adjusted easily by varying the concentration of NaI or NaSCN and needs more careful rheological study.},

abstract = {With the rapid intensification of urban heat islands worldwide, measures for its mitigation are gaining attention. Some of the most popular measures are based on employing evaporative cooling, altering the surfaces' albedo or making use of shading. In this paper, we numerically investigate the influence of each of these three methods on the comfort of a pedestrian in a typical urban street canyon. The environmental conditions in the urban street canyon are obtained from a detailed microclimatic model, and serve as input for a comfort model based on the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Simulations are conducted for average summer conditions, taken from a typical meteorological year (TMY), and for heat wave (HW) conditions. The results show that evaporative cooling can considerably reduce the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature, but that the corresponding increase in vapor pressure limits the net gain in comfort. Shading results in significantly reduced surface temperatures, in addition to decreasing the intensity of direct solar irradiation, both leading to an increased comfort sensation. Increasing the local albedo of urban surfaces also leads to lower surface temperatures, but does not affect the amount of direct solar irradiation, explaining the lower comfort gain compared to shading. The cooling effect of all methods proved to increase during a HW in comparison to a TMY. These observations show that the effectiveness of mitigation measures highly depends on the climatic conditions and demonstrate the potential of microclimatic models to determine the optimal combination of measures for a given context. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A model is presented which solves simultaneously for leafscale stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation and the energy balance as a function of leaf position within canopies of well-watered vegetation, Fluxes and conductances were calculated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves, A linear dependence of photosynthetic capacity on leaf nitrogen content was assumed, while leaf nitrogen content and light intensity were assumed to decrease exponentially within canopies, Separate extinction coefficients were used for diffuse and direct beam radiation, An efficient Gaussian integration technique was used to compute fluxes and mean conductances for the canopy, The multilayer model synthesizes current knowledge of radiation penetration, leaf physiology and the physics of evaporation and provides insights into the response of whole canopies to multiple, interacting factors, The model was also used to explore sources of variation in the slopes of two simple parametric models (nitrogen- and light-use efficiency), and to set bounds on the magnitudes of the parameters, For canopies low in total N, daily assimilation rates are similar to 10{\%} lower when leaf N is distributed uniformly than when the same total N is distributed according to the exponentially decreasing profile of absorbed radiation, However, gains are negligible for plants with high N concentrations, Canopy conductance, G(c), should be calculated as G(c) = Lambda Sigma(f(sl)g(sl)+f(sh)g(sh)), where Lambda is leaf area index, f(sl) and f(sh) are the fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves at each level, and g(sl) and g(sh) are the corresponding stomatal conductances, Simple addition of conductances without this weighting causes errors in transpiration calculated using the 'big-leaf' version of the Penman-Monteith equation, Partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat is very responsive to the parameter describing the sensitivity of stomata to the atmospheric humidity deficit, This parameter also affects canopy conductance, but has a relatively small impact on canopy assimilation, Simple parametric models are useful for extrapolating understanding from small to large scales, but the complexity of real ecosystems is thus subsumed in unexplained variations in parameter values, Simulations with the multilayer model show that both nitrogen- and radiation-use efficiencies depend on plant nutritional status and the diffuse component of incident radiation, causing a 2- to 3-fold variation in these efficiencies.},

abstract = {Wind statistics were measured using cup and sonic anemometers, placed upwind and downwind from a porous plastic windbreak fence (height h = 1.25 m, length Y = 114 m, resistance coefficient k(r0) = 2.4, and porosity p = 0.45) standing on otherwise uniform land ( short grass with roughness length z(0) similar to 1.9 cm). Intercomparison with collocated two-dimensional sonic anemometers suggested that, except in strongly stratified winds, cup anemometers (distance constant 1.5 m), subjected to a uniform overspeeding correction (here similar to10{\%}), provide a reasonably accurate transect of the mean wind across the disturbed flow region. The measurements, binned with respect to mean wind direction and stratification, establish that the resistance coefficient of a windbreak of this type implies the maximum (or "potential'') mean wind reduction, a potential that is realized in neutral, perpendicular flow and for which a semiempirical formula is derived. Obliquity of the approaching wind reduces actual shelter effectiveness below the potential value, as was already known. However, a systematic influence of stratification could only be discriminated in winds that were not too far ( say, within about +/-30degrees) from perpendicular, under which conditions both stable and unstable stratification reduced shelter effectiveness. The "quiet zone,'' in which velocity standard deviations (sigma(u), sigma(v)) are reduced relative to the approach flow, was found to extend farther downwind for the normal velocity component (u) than for the parallel component (v).},

abstract = {The efficiency of pesticide application to agricultural fields and the resulting environmental contamination highly depend on atmospheric airflow. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of airflow within plant canopies using 3D canopy architecture was developed to understand the effect of the canopy to airflow. The model average air velocity was validated using experimental results in a wind tunnel with two artificial model trees of 24 cm height. Mean air velocities and their root mean square (RMS) values were measured on a vertical plane upstream and downstream sides of the trees in the tunnel using 2D hotwire anemometer after imposing a uniform air velocity of 10 m s-1at the inlet. 3D virtual canopy geometries of the artificial trees were modelled and introduced into a computational fluid domain whereby airflow through the trees was simulated using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. There was good agreement of the average longitudinal velocity, U between the measurements and the simulation results with relative errors less than 2{\%} for upstream and 8{\%} for downstream sides of the trees. The accuracy of the model prediction for turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence intensity I was acceptable within the tree height when using a roughness length (y0= 0.02 mm) for the surface roughness of the tree branches and by applying a source model in a porous sub-domain created around the trees. The approach was applied for full scale orchard trees in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and was compared with previous approaches and works. The simulation in the ABL was made using two groups of full scale orchard trees; short (h = 3 m) with wider branching and long (h = 4 m) with narrow branching. This comparison showed good qualitative agreements on the vertical profiles of U with small local differences as expected due to the spatial disparities in tree architecture. This work was able to show airflow within and above the canopy in 3D in more details. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A parametric study of the factors contributing to peak-locking, a known bias error source in PIV, is conducted using synthetic data that are processed with a state-of-the-art PIV algorithm. The investigated parameters include: particle diameter, image interpolation techniques, the effect of asymmetric vs. symmetric window shifting, number of passes and the interrogation window size. Some of these parameters are found to have a profound effect on the magnitude of the peak- locking error. The effects for specific PIV cameras are also studied experimentally using a precision turntable to generate a known rotating velocity field. Image time series recorded using this experiment show a linear range of pixel and sub-pixel shifts ranging from 0 to ±4 pixels. Deviations in the constant vorticity field ($\omega$z) reveal how peak-locking can be affected systematically both by varying parameters of the detection system such as the focal distance and f-number, and also by varying the settings of the PIV analysis. A new a priori method technique for reducing the bias errors associated with peak-locking in PIV is introduced using an optical diffuser to avoid undersampled particle images during the recording of the raw images. This technique is evaluated against other a priori approaches using experimental data and is shown to perform favorably. Finally, a new a posteriori Anti Peak-locking Filter (APLF) is developed and investigated, which shows promising results for both synthetic data and real measurements for very small particle image sizes. 1},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether breastfeeding reduced the risk of childhood obesity in the infants of a multi-ethnic cohort of women with pregestational diabetes. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, women with pregestational diabetes were mailed a questionnaire about breastfeeding and current height and weight of mothers and infants. Predictors of obesity (weight for age {\textgreater}85 percentile) were assessed among offspring of index pregnancies, using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results. Of 125 women, 81 (65{\%}) had type 1 diabetes and 44 (35{\%}) had type 2 diabetes. The mean age of offspring was 4.5 years. On univariate analysis, significant predictors of obesity in offspring were type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, OR 2.4, 95{\%} confidence interval, CI 0.99-5.72); maternal body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} 25 (OR 4.4, 95{\%} CI 1.4-19.4); and any breastfeeding (OR 0.22, 95{\%} CI 0.07-0.72). After multivariable adjustment, breastfeeding (OR 0.20, 95{\%} CI 0.06-0.69) and having an overweight/obese mother (OR 3.49, 95{\%} CI 1.03-16.2) remained independently associated with childhood obesity. Conclusion. Breastfeeding significantly decreased the likelihood of obesity in offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes, independent of maternal BMI and diabetes type. Women with diabetes should be encouraged to breastfeed, given the increased risk of obesity in their children.},

abstract = {This study presents an analysis of air circulation and microclimate distribution during daytime in a 1-ha Canary type tomato greenhouse in the coastal area of southern Morocco. The investigation of the climate inside the greenhouse is based on a numerical simulation using a finite volumes method to solve the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The main novelty of this simulation lies in the realism of the 3D modelling of this very large agricultural structure with (i) a coupling of convective and radiative exchanges at the surface of the plastic roof cover, (ii) simulation of the dynamic influence of the insect screens and tomato crop on airflow movement, using the concept of porous medium, (iii) simulation, in each grid cell of the crop canopy, of the sensible and latent heat exchanges between the greenhouse air and the tomato crop, and (iv) detailed simulation of climate parameters in a 1-ha real-scale commercial greenhouse. The model simulations were first validated with respect to temperature and relative humidity fields measured inside the experimental greenhouse for fairly steady-state outside conditions marked by a prevailing sea breeze around the solar noon. A good agreement was observed between the measured and simulated values for inside air temperatures and specific humidity. It was next used for exploring the details of the inside air temperature and humidity fields and plant microclimates and transpiration fluxes throughout the greenhouse space. Simulation for a wind direction perpendicular to the side and roof openings shows that the insect screen significantly reduced inside air velocity and increased inside temperature and humidity, especially in the vicinity of the crop canopy. It revealed the details of the flow field within the greenhouse. At the windward end of the greenhouse, the flow field was marked by a strong windwise air current above the tomato canopy which was fed by the windward side vent, and a slow air stream flowing within the tomato canopy space. Then, from the first third of the greenhouse to the leeward end, the flow field was marked by the combination of wind and buoyancy forces, with warmer and more humid inside air which was evacuated through the upper roof vents, while colder and dryer air was penetrated through the upper roof vent openings. Based on these simulations, design studies of the greenhouse crop system were performed to improve inside air temperature and humidity conditions by simple modifications of orientation of the crop rows. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Greenhouse technology is an effective method of cultivation of flowers, crops, etc. under controlled environment. For any greenhouse, ventilation performance is a major factor in production, influencing the yield and quality of the products. Natural ventilation can be effectively used to maintain greenhouse microclimate, conducive to plant growth, when the ambient conditions are not extreme. The present paper discusses the modeling aspects of a floriculture greenhouse suitable for operation in typical Indian climate under natural ventilation. Combined ridge and sidewall ventilation is considered in the model. The model is validated against the test results of an experimental greenhouse. Parametric analysis is also done to understand the effects of variations in parameters such as wind speed, solar radiation intensity, effective greenhouse height etc. The study reveals that the performance of a greenhouse under natural ventilation is influenced considerably by parameters such as intensity of solar radiation, effective distance between the side and the roof vents, free wind speed etc. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Drag coefficient is an important index of the wind protection effect of a windbreak. Although there have been many studies on this, there are very few with direct measurements, especially those on realistic windbreaks. We conducted wind-tunnel experiments on simulated models of narrow and realistic windbreaks with different porosities. The surface boundary layer on the wind-tunnel floor was simulated with a thickness of 600 mm. The model, with height (H) of 100 mm, was immersed in the simulated surface boundary layer during measurements. The ratio of the model height to roughness length of the surface (H/z0) was 774. Two indices, optical porosity (??) and aerodynamic porosity (??), were used. The bleed wind speed of the model was measured to calculate aerodynamic porosity. The relative bleed speed was generally lower at the canopy crown and higher at the bottom surface. Dense model canopy had smaller standard deviation (S.D.) in aerodynamic porosity along the crosswind direction. The relationship between ?? and ?? resulted in ?? = ??0.4 for realistic windbreak models. The divergence of ?? and ?? was largest near 0.5 and 0.2, respectively and then decreased as the windbreak became denser or looser. The drag (D) and drag coefficient (Cd) of the models decreased with increasing porosity. The model Cd remained nearly constant within the range of Reynolds number measured in this study. The resultant Cd of our realistic model was lower than that of other studies using two-dimensional windbreaks with the same optical porosity. Our empirical relationship between C d and ?? (i.e. Cd = 1.08(1 - ??1.8)) agreed well with that of two-dimensional windbreaks reported in the literature, suggesting that ?? was a better measure as porosity index than ??. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Temperature is spatially heterogeneous over leaf surfaces, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully resolved. We hypothesized that the 3D leaf microtopography determines locally the amount of incoming irradiation flux at leaf surface, thereby driving the temperature gradient over the leaf surface. This hypothesis was tested by developing a model of leaf temperature heterogeneity that includes the development of the leaf boundary layer, the microtopography of the leaf surface and the physiological response of the leaf. Temperature distributions under various irradiation loads (1) over apple leaves based on their 3D microtopography, (2) over simulated flat (2D) apple leaves and (3) over 3D leaves with a transpiration rate distributed as in 2D leaves were simulated. Accuracy of the predictions was quantified by comparing model outputs and thermographic measurements of leaf surface temperature under controlled conditions. Only the model with 3D leaves predicted accurately the spatial heterogeneity of surface temperature over single leaves whereas the mean temperature was well predicted by both 2D and 3D leaves. We suggest that in these conditions the 3D leaf microtopography is the primary driver of leaf surface heterogeneity in temperature when the leaf is exposed to a light/heat source.},

abstract = {'Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94 ??C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD is used to evaluate the forced convective heat transfer at the surfaces of a cube immersed in a turbulent boundary layer, for applications in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind flow around surface-mounted obstacles such as buildings. Two specific configurations are analysed. First, a cube placed in turbulent channel flow at a Reynolds number of 4.6 ?? 103 is considered to validate the numerical predictions by comparison with wind-tunnel measurements. The results obtained with low-Reynolds number modelling (LRNM) show a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for the windward surface. Secondly, a cube exposed to high-Reynolds number ABL flow is considered. The heat transfer in the boundary layer is analysed in detail. The dimensionless parameter y*, which takes into account turbulence, is found to be more appropriate for evaluating heat transfer than the commonly used y+ value. Standard wall functions, which are frequently used for high-Reynolds number flows, overestimate the convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) significantly (??50{\%}) compared to LRNM. The distribution of the CHTC-U10 correlation over the windward surface is reported for Reynolds numbers of 3.5 ?? 104 to 3.5 ?? 106 based on the cube height and U10, where U10 is the wind speed in the undisturbed flow at a height of 10 m. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A widespread perception is that, with increasing wind speed, transpiration from plant leaves increases. However, evidence suggests that increasing wind speed enhances carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake while reducing transpiration due to more efficient convective cooling (under high solar radiation loads). We provide theoretical and experimental evidence that leaf water use efficiency (WUE, carbon uptake per water transpired) commonly increases with increasing wind speed, thus improving plants' ability to conserve water during photosynthesis. Our leaf-scale analysis suggests that the observed global decrease in near-surface wind speeds could have reduced WUE at a magnitude similar to the increase in WUE attributed to global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, there is indication that the effect of long-term trends in wind speed on leaf gas exchange may be compensated for by the concurrent reduction in mean leaf sizes. These unintuitive feedbacks between wind, leaf size and water use efficiency call for re-evaluation of the role of wind in plant water relations and potential re-interpretation of temporal and geographic trends in leaf sizes.},

abstract = {In greenhouses, reducing water consumption by increasing water efficiency is of high interest. To reach this goal, predictive models of soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer could be helpful. However, such models have been mainly developed for open field conditions, and very few models exist for greenhouse plants grown in pots. Moreover, most of these models were implemented under well-watered conditions, but very few are available under water restriction. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated soil-plant-atmosphere water balance model applied to potted plants grown in greenhouses, to predict plant transpiration under different restrictive irrigation regimes. Implementing such a model requires an accurate estimation of stomatal resistance Rs under water restriction conditions. Rs is then used in the Penman-Monteith model to evaluate transpiration. To establish the model parameters, an experiment was conducted for sixteen weeks inside a greenhouse with ornamental plants (New Guinea Impatiens) grown in containers on shelves. Well-watered and water restriction conditions were applied. The peat matric potential, radiation, temperature and humidity were continuously recorded, while Rs was measured and transpiration was assessed every half-hour from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16 weeks after planting. The resulting model was first validated against experimental measurements during the twelfth week of the experiment. It displayed good correlations for both the instantaneous data and integrated total transpiration. Different scenarios of irrigation reduction (frequency x volume) were tested and the results indicated real potential for water use reduction. Indeed, by reducing water application by 50{\%} and by applying one irrigation per day, transpiration was not affected.},

abstract = {In order to develop climate resilient urban areas and reduce emissions, several opportunities exist starting from conscious planning and design of green (and blue) spaces in these landscapes. Green urban infrastructure has been regarded as beneficial, e.g. by balancing water flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e.g. CO2sequestration) as well as social and psychological benefits (e.g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of green urban infrastructure complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from green urban infrastructures on three spatial scales (i.e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions. The manuscript identifies avenues for further research on the role of green urban infrastructure, in different types of cities, climates and social contexts. Our systematic understanding of the bio-physical and social processes defining various services allows targeting stressors that may hamper the provision of green urban infrastructure services in individual behavior as well as in wider planning and environmental management in urban areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study presents an analysis of air circulation and microclimate distribution during daytime in a 1-ha Canary type tomato greenhouse in the coastal area of southern Morocco. The investigation of the climate inside the greenhouse is based on a numerical simulation using a finite volumes method to solve the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The main novelty of this simulation lies in the realism of the 3D modelling of this very large agricultural structure with (i) a coupling of convective and radiative exchanges at the surface of the plastic roof cover, (ii) simulation of the dynamic influence of the insect screens and tomato crop on airflow movement, using the concept of porous medium, (iii) simulation, in each grid cell of the crop canopy, of the sensible and latent heat exchanges between the greenhouse air and the tomato crop, and (iv) detailed simulation of climate parameters in a 1-ha real-scale commercial greenhouse. The model simulations were first validated with respect to temperature and relative humidity fields measured inside the experimental greenhouse for fairly steady-state outside conditions marked by a prevailing sea breeze around the solar noon. A good agreement was observed between the measured and simulated values for inside air temperatures and specific humidity. It was next used for exploring the details of the inside air temperature and humidity fields and plant microclimates and transpiration fluxes throughout the greenhouse space. Simulation for a wind direction perpendicular to the side and roof openings shows that the insect screen significantly reduced inside air velocity and increased inside temperature and humidity, especially in the vicinity of the crop canopy. It revealed the details of the flow field within the greenhouse. At the windward end of the greenhouse, the flow field was marked by a strong windwise air current above the tomato canopy which was fed by the windward side vent, and a slow air stream flowing within the tomato canopy space. Then, from the first third of the greenhouse to the leeward end, the flow field was marked by the combination of wind and buoyancy forces, with warmer and more humid inside air which was evacuated through the upper roof vents, while colder and dryer air was penetrated through the upper roof vent openings. Based on these simulations, design studies of the greenhouse crop system were performed to improve inside air temperature and humidity conditions by simple modifications of orientation of the crop rows. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present work proposes a methodology for the a posteriori quantification of the uncertainty of pressure data retrieved from PIV measurements. It relies upon the Bayesian framework, where the posterior distribution (probability distribution of the true velocity, given the PIV measurements) is obtained from the prior distribution (prior knowledge of the velocity, e.g., within a certain bound or divergence-free) and the distribution representing the PIV measurement uncertainty. Once the posterior covariance matrix of the velocity is known, it is propagated through the discretized Poisson equation for pressure. Numerical assessment of the proposed method on a steady Lamb Oseen vortex shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, while linear uncertainty propagation underestimates the uncertainty of the pressure by up to 30{\%}. The method is finally applied to an experimental test case of a turbulent boundary layer in air, obtained using time-resolved tomographic PIV. The pressure reconstructed from tomographic PIV data is compared to a microphone measurement conducted simultaneously at the wall to determine the actual error of the former. The comparison between actual error and estimated uncertainty shows the accuracy of the proposed method for uncertainty quantification of pressure data from tomographic PIV experiments: for a 95{\%} confidence level, 93{\%} of the data points fall within the estimated uncertainty bound with the Eulerian approach, and 90{\%} with the Lagrangian approach. When using the prior knowledge that the velocity field should be divergence-free, these values are 98{\%} with the Eulerian approach and 94{\%} with the Lagrangian approach. The Lagrangian approach results in more accurate reconstructed pressure fields than the Eulerian approach. Also, enforcing the divergence-free constraint is found to result in a more accurate reconstructed pressure field.

abstract = {In this work, we propose a simple method to simultaneously match the refractive index and kinematic viscosity of a circulating blood analog in hydraulic models for optical flow measurement tech-niques (PIV, PMFV, LDA, and LIF). The method is based on the determination of the volumetric proportions and temperature at which two transparent miscible liquids should be mixed to repro-duce the targeted fluid characteristics. The temperature depen-dence models are a linear relation for the refractive index and an Arrhenius relation for the dynamic viscosity of each liquid. Then the dynamic viscosity of the mixture is represented with a Grunberg-Nissan model of type 1. Experimental tests for acrylic and blood viscosity were found to be in very good agreement with the targeted values (measured refractive index of 1.486 and kine-matic viscosity of 3.454 milli-m 2 /s with targeted values of 1.47 and 3.300 milli-m 2 /s).},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the microclimate inside a greenhouse canopy were validated. Experiments were conducted inside a 100m2greenhouse compartment with a shading screen and potted Impatiens plants grown on benches. The greenhouse was equipped with a set of sensors, including a sonic and hot-bulb anemometers, thermocouples, air-humidity/temperature probes and balances.Thermal and water vapour exchanges between the crop and its environment were studied using 2D simulations of the microclimate carried out at a daily time scale within a calculation domain reduced to a parallelepiped, including the plants. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved using the standard k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. A crop submodel which considers the crop as a porous medium and adds specific source terms for latent and sensible heat transfers was used. Two contrasting days with relatively high and low solar insulations were considered. For both cases, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model showed its ability to simulate the air temperature inside the canopy as well as the vertical distribution of the leaf temperatures throughout the day. It predicted the decrease of leaf temperature from the top to the bottom of the crop with good accuracy. It also provided a good estimation for the trend of transpiration rate throughout the day (coefficients of determination. {\textgreater}. 0.92). Differences between the measured and simulated integrated transpiration rates over 24. h-periods remained. {\textless}. 15{\%}. Consequently, the model could be useful to assess the water requirements of a crop for the purpose of adapting irrigation management to meet plant needs. {\textcopyright} 2012 IAgrE.},

abstract = {This paper considers the flow in porous media that occurs in coastal and offshore engineering problems. Over the past decades numerous formulations of flow equations for porous media have been presented. The present work re-examines the porous media equations of the most recent form and corrects some shortcomings which were identified. The applied type of porosity models relies on empirical resistance coefficients which often need to be measured or calibrated. Only few examples of calibration for numerical models which are present in the literature often applied the same experimental results. In this study new calibration cases were introduced to the calibration procedure in order to achieve a better understanding of the variation of the resistance coefficients. Hereby the coefficients were determined with a better description over the entire parameter space for the resistance coefficients than previously found in the literature. Constant values for the resistance coefficients for a broad range of flow conditions were recommended based on the new calibrations. The model was validated for the main physical processes that occur in wave-structure interaction in coastal structures including three-dimensional wave-structure interaction, run-up, run-down and pressure damping, regular and irregular wave conditions and evaluation of overtopping. Simple two and three dimensional uniform caisson structures and breakwater layouts were investigated. The model was implemented in the open source CFD library OpenFOAM{\textregistered} and has been made publicly available to the engineering community as part of the wave generation framework waves2Foam. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We used neutron radiography (NR), a non-invasive and in situ technique, to study living plant roots in soil. Plant roots have a larger water content than their unsaturated surrounding media. As water strongly attenuates a neutron-beam, NR can identify root structures in detail. We investigated the use of NR to visualize the root growth of lupin in quartz sand and in a loamy sand field soil. Further experiments elucidated the root growth of lupin in the loamy sand heterogeneously contaminated with 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) boron (B) and 100 mg kg(-1) zinc (Zn). We obtained high-quality images of root growth dynamics in both media with a resolution range of 110-270 mu m. The images with quartz sand revealed fine structures such as proteoid roots that are difficult to locate in situ by other methods without destruction of the soil. Though quartz sand provided excellent visibility of roots, it proved to be a poor medium for growing plants, probably because of its bulk density (1.8 Mg m(-3)). The images with field soil showed normal root growth with slightly less contrast than the quartz sand. The poorer contrast was due to the greater neutron interaction with soil water and soil organic matter. In the heterogeneously contaminated soil, root growth was significantly reduced in the contaminated part of the soil in all B and Zn treatments. This study shows that NR has potential as a non-invasive method to investigate root growth over time as well as the response of roots to various abiotic stress factors.},

abstract = {Tree biomechanics studies using dynamic methods of analysis are reviewed. The emphasis in this review is on the biomechanics of open-grown trees typically found in urban areas, rather than trees in forests or plantations. The distinction is not based on species but on their form, because open-grown trees usually grow with considerable branch mass and the dynamic response in winds may be different to other tree forms. Methods of dynamic analysis applied to trees are reviewed. Simple tree models have been developed to understand tree dynamic responses, but these largely ignore the dynamics of branches. More complex models and finite element analyses are developing a multimodal approach to represent the dynamics of branches on trees. Results indicate that material properties play only a limited role in tree dynamics and it is the form and morphology of the tree and branches that can influence the dynamics of trees. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society of Arboriculture.},

The applications of the model include a one-dimensional comparison with a laboratory experiment, the two-dimensional boundary layer development over a canopy and a three-dimensional analysis of secondary flow patterns generated by a canopy.

Our sensitivity methodology relies on the non-intrusive approach of the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method; the gPC is a spectral non-statistical numerical method well-suited to representing random processes not restricted to Gaussian fields. The analysis is carried out at Re$\lambda$=100 and for different grid resolutions and Cs distributions. Numerical predictions are also compared to direct numerical simulation evidence. We have shown that the different turbulent scales of the LES solution respond differently to the variability in Cs. In particular, the study of the relative turbulent kinetic energy distributions for different Cs distributions indicates that small scales are mainly affected by changes in the subgrid-model parametric uncertainty.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Urban trees regulate their thermal environment mostly through the canopies. With multilayered com-plex canopies trees prevent solar radiation (reaching the ground) thus reduce the heat storage under-neath. More importantly the intercepted energy rather increases the latent heat flux, hence reduces the air temperature during the daytime. However, there is little information on within canopy temperature of urban trees and inter-relationships between latent heat flux exchanges to identify thermal impact of vegetation. The present study continuously measured sapflow and within the canopy air temperature of Tilia cordata trees along with meteorological variables at two different street canyons in Munich, Ger-many over the summer, 2015. Within the canopy radius of 4.5 m, daytime temperature reduced up to 3.5 C with energy loss of 75 W m {\`{A}}2 during warm and dry August when the soil moisture potential was below 1.5 MPa and vapour pressure deficit was 4 kPa, but the nighttime temperature went up to 0.5 C. Deeper underneath the tree canopy, 1.5 m above the ground the average temperature fell by up to 0.85 C on hot sunny days. The regression equation showed better agreement of this air temperature reduction with the sap flow of trees (R 2 ¼ 0.61) rather than the differences between shaded and unshaded, paved and grass surface temperatures. Although the research is at an early stage, the results showed the po-tential of using canopy air temperature differences as a tool to better understand the transpiration response to within and below canopy temperature and also to be used in climate models.},

This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements and challenges are discussed.

abstract = {Light canopy transmittance and the Beer-Lambert equation were utilized to assess monthly leaf area index (LAI) of a tropical deciduous forest ecosystem on the west coast of Mexico. The light transmittance coefficient (k) was obtained by analyzing vertical leaf and light distribution in the forest canopy. An independent LAI estimate was obtained using litterfall data. The calculated k value was 0.610 ± 0.035 (standard error). Average maximum LAI obtained with litterfall data was 4.2 ± 0.4 m2m-2. There was a significant correlation (P {\textless} 0.001, r = 0.98) between litter-LAI estimations and those obtained with the Beer-Lambert equation. The regression explained 95{\%} of the variation; however, light-LAI overestimated litter-LAI by a constant of 0.87 ± 0.12 m2 m-2 (the slope was 1.03 and Y intercept was 0.87). The discrepancy is partially attributed to leaf retention of the few evergreen species, and perhaps leaf retention of a few deciduous species beyond the end of the litterfall collection. Maximum annual LAI was similar in both study years (4.5 ± 0.3 m2 m-2 in 1990 and 4.9 ± 0.4 in 1991). Minimum LAI showed considerable variation between years with similar values in the dry seasons of 1990 and 1991 (1.0 ± 0.1 m2 and 0.9 ± 0.1 m2 m-2, respectively), but much higher values in 1992 (2.7 ± 0.2 m2 m-2). The difference is probably attributed to an atypical rainfall event in January 1992 (644 mm), which retarded leaf abscission. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Methods for matching the in vivo compliance and elastic wave propagation wavelength are presented. The manipulation of MRI and CT scan data through an investment casting mould is described. A method for the casting of bubble-free phantoms in silicone elastomer is given. The method is applied to fabricate flexible phantoms of the carotid artery (with and without stenosis), the carotid artery bifurcation (idealised and patient-specific) and the human upper airway (nasal cavity). The fidelity of the phantoms to the original scan data is measured, and it is shown that the cross-sectional error is less than 5{\%} for phantoms of simple shape but up to 16{\%} for complex cross-sectional shapes such as the nasal cavity. This error is mainly due to the application of a PVA coating to the inner mould and can be reduced by shrinking the digital model. Sixteen per cent variation in area is less than the natural patient to patient variation of the physiological geometries. The compliance of the phantom walls is controlled within physiologically realistic ranges, by choice of the wall thickness, transmural pressure and Young's modulus of the elastomer. Data for the dependence of Young's modulus on curing temperature are given for Sylgard 184. Data for the temperature dependence of density, viscosity and refractive index of the refractive-index-matched working liquid (i.e. water-glycerol mixtures) are also presented.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have explored the role of vegetation in controlling and mediating hydrological states and fluxes at the level of individual processes, which has led to improvements in our understanding of plot-scale dynamics. Relatively less effort has been directed toward spatially-explicit studies of vegetation-hydrology interactions at larger scales of a landscape. Only few continuous, process-oriented ecohydrological models had been proposed with structures of varying complexity. This study contributes to their further evolution and presents a novel ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. The model synthesizes the state-of-the-art knowledge on individual processes and coupling mechanisms drawn from the disciplines of hydrology, plant physiology, and ecology. Specifically, the model reproduces all essential components of the hydrological cycle: it resolves the mass and energy budgets in the atmospheric surface layer at the hourly scale, while representing up to two layers of vegetation; it includes a module of snowpack evolution; it describes the saturated and unsaturated soil water dynamics, processes of runoff generation and flow routing. The component of vegetation dynamics parameterizes life cycle processes of different plant functional types, including photosynthesis, phenology, carbon allocation, and tissue turnover. This study presents a confirmation of the long-term, plot-scale model performance by simulating two types of ecosystems corresponding to different climate conditions. A consistent and highly satisfactory model skill in reproducing the energy and water budgets as well as physiological cycles of plants with minimum calibration overhead is demonstrated. Furthermore, these applications demonstrate that the model permits the identification of data types and observation frequencies crucial for appropriate evaluation of modeled dynamics. More importantly, through a synthesis of a wide array of process representations, the model ensures that climate, soil, vegetation, and topography collectively identify essential modes controlling ecohydrological systems, i.e., that satisfactory performance is a result of appropriate mimicking of internal processes.},

Each is shown to produce distinct micro- to local scale climates contributing to the larger urban climate mosaic. These effects are discussed in relation to the radiative, aerodynamic, thermal and moisture properties of trees that so clearly set them apart from other urban materials and surfaces in terms of their exchanges of heat, mass and momentum with the atmosphere. Their resulting ability to produce shade, coolness, shelter, moisture and air filtration makes them flexible tools for environmental design.},

This paper gives a brief background on evolution of PIV and then its principle of operation, main features and basic elements are explaind. Errors in PIV occurring while measurements are discussed and, the state-of-the-art of the technique today is overviewed and illustrated by reference to recent, seminal publications describing both the development and application of PIV.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. We investigate wicking in textiles using neutron radiography on fabrics of two types, woven and simple jersey knit, and made of yarns of four different materials: cotton, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide and polypropylene. Moisture distribution in the samples is quantified from the images, and the total mass is compared with gravimetric measurements for validation. The position of the front versus time is obtained from segmented neutron images and backlight images, with good agreement between the two measurement methods. Using a power law to fit the height versus time curves, values for the wicking ratio are found to depart substantially from the 0.5 predicted by the Lucas–Washburn equation. The sharp front approximation is found to be a good approximation for slow wicking fabrics but is an incomplete description of the moisture on high absorbing fabrics such as cotton. The variation of yarn material is the main contributor to the difference of wicking ratio among samples. Finally, neutron moisture profiles complemented with X-ray tomography allow to differentiate two regions in cotton wetted by wicking: intra-yarn wetting and wetting covering the yarns and the inter-yarn voids.},

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) effects can strengthen heat waves and air pollution episodes. In this study, the dampening impact of urban trees on the UHI during an extreme heat wave in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area is examined by incorporating trees, soil, and grass into the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model and an urban canopy model (WRF-UCM). By parameterizing the effects of these natural surfaces alongside roadways and buildings, the modified WRF-UCM is used to in- vestigate how urban trees, soil, and grass dampen the UHI. The modified model was run with 50{\%} tree cover over urban roads and a 10{\%} decrease in the width of urban streets to make space for soil and grass alongside the roads and buildings. Results show that, averaged over all urban areas, the added vegetation decreases surface air temperature in urban street canyons by 4.1 K and road-surface and building-wall temperatures by 15.4 and 8.9 K, respectively, as a result of tree shading and evapotranspiration. These temperature changes propagate downwind and alter the temperature gradient associated with the Chesapeake Bay breeze and, therefore, alter the strength of the bay breeze. The impact of building height on theUHI shows that decreasing commercial building heights by 8 m and residential building heights by 2.5 m results in up to 0.4-K higher daytime surface and near-surface air temperatures because of less building shading and up to 1.2-K lower nighttime temperatures because of less longwave radiative trapping in urban street canyons.},

abstract = {In Earth system modelling, a description of the energy budget of the vegetated surface layer is fundamental as it determines the meteorological conditions in the planetary boundary layer and as such contributes to the atmospheric conditions and its circulation. The energy budget in most Earth system models has long been based on a "big-leaf approach", with averaging schemes that represent in-canopy processes. Such models have difficulties in reproducing consistently the energy balance in field observations. We here outline a newly developed numerical model for energy budget simulation, as a component of the land surface model ORCHIDEE-CAN (Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems – CANopy). This new model implements techniques from single-site canopy models in a practical way. It includes representation of in-canopy transport, a multilayer longwave radiation budget, height-specific calculation of aerodynamic and stomatal conductance, and interaction with the bare soil flux within the canopy space. Significantly, it avoids iterations over the height of tha canopy and so maintains implicit coupling to the atmospheric model LMDz. As a first test, the model is evaluated against data from both an intensive measurement campaign and longer term eddy covariance measurements for the intensively studied Eucalyptus stand at Tumbarumba, Australia. The model performs well in replicating both diurnal and annual cycles of fluxes, as well as the gradients of sensible heat fluxes. However, the model overestimates sensible heat flux against an underestimate of the radiation budget. Improved performance is expected through the implementation of a more detailed calculation of stand albedo and a more up-to-date stomatal conductance calculation.},

The fluxes of radiation are treated in the photosynthetic (PAR), near infrared (NIR) and thermal wavebands; beam and diffuse radiation are considered separately. The spatial heterogeneity of the leaf area density distribution within the tree crown has been incorporated into MAESTRO, which can be used to study the spatial distribution of the radiation regime, and of the water vapour and carbon dioxide exchanges of leaves within the tree crown, in relation to stand structure. This model has been tested by comparing the calculated hourly and daily fluxes of PAR with measurements made by quantum sensors at locations below the tree crowns using three different submodels of leaf area density distribution. Good agreement between measurements and predictions was obtained. ?? 1990.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Using a pulsed-wire anemometer, extensive measurements have been made in the wakes of two-dimensional solid and porous fences immersed in the constant-stress region of a simulated rural atmospheric boundary-layer. The porosity (ratio of open to total area) of the perforated fences ranged from 0.0 to 0.5 and each porosity was modelled using three forms of openings, i.e. vertical slats, horizontal slats and circular holes. Comparative measurements made using the more conventional hot-wire anemometer are given. The results show the superiority of the pulsed-wire anemometer in correctly measuring the highly turbulent and sometimes recirculating wake flows. This indicates that previously reported experiments may be in considerable error. Results from the present experiment are given in the form of dimensionless mean and turbulence velocity profiles. In addition, contour plots of shelter parameters behind the fences are given for comfort and shelter analyses. Downstream of the re-attachment region, velocity deficits and excess shear and normal stress perturbations (quantities useful in shelter analyses) are plotted in a self-preserving form and simple equations that fit the experimental points are given. Power spectra measured in the presence of the solid fence are given and the structure of the turbulent wake deduced from these is discussed.},

abstract = {The flow across a three-dimensional (3-D) windbreak comprising individual cypress trees is studied to establish the significance and extent of the 3-D flow patterns. The cypress tree is modelled as a solid cylindrical stem and a conic porous canopy. Cases with a single row of trees or two rows of trees with different distances between the rows are considered; in the case of a single row, several densities of the canopy are used. The steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approximation is solved using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package and a high-resolution mesh. Three-dimensional flow is found in the vicinity of the windbreak up to a leeward distance of 1–2 tree-heights, depending on the density of the canopy, and is manifest as significant lateral variations and reduced vertical flow. At larger leeward distances, a two-dimensional (2-D) flow is established with characteristics similar to existing 2-D studies; the flow leeward of the last row is insensitive to the distance between the rows. Homogeneous 2-D windbreak models are found to be inaccurate in the vicinity of the windbreak. This is exactly the region that needs to be sheltered in many cases, since the inner vegetation is anyway protected by the outer vegetation.},

abstract = {As shading, an important factor in urban environments, affects thermal environments and long-term thermal comfort, this study conducted several field experiments to analyze the outdoor thermal conditions on urban streets in central Taiwan. The RayMan model was utilized for predicting long-term thermal comfort using meteorological data for a 10-year period. Analytical results indicate that slightly shaded areas typically have highly frequent hot conditions during summer, particularly at noon. However, highly shaded locations generally have a low physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) during winter. Correlation analysis reveals that thermal comfort is best when a location is shaded during spring, summer, and autumn. During winter, low-shade conditions may contribute to the increase in solar radiation; thus, thermal comfort is improved when a location has little shade in winter. We suggest that a certain shading level is best for urban streets, and trees or shade devices should be used to improve the original thermal environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An important part of the world's energy is used for space cooling of buildings. Minimisation of space cooling, especially in hot urban environments, has great energy-saving potential. An important part of the heat exchange between buildings and the ambient surrounding is due to convective and radiative heat flows. The impact of these heat flows on energy consumption for cooling is much more important in urban areas compared to rural areas. This study aims at quantifying the influence of the urban radiation balance, the urban heat island effect and urban convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTC) on the space cooling demands. CHTC correlations were determined using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for different geometries including stand-alone buildings and street canyons of different lengths. Buoyancy was accounted for by considering differences between building surface and surrounding air temperature. It was found that the building geometry has a large impact on the CHTC correlations and that the effect of buoyancy cannot be neglected when wind speeds are low. These CHTC correlations were used for Building Energy Simulation (BES) predictions of the space cooling demand. Space cooling demands for a building in a street canyon differ up to a factor of 1.8 depending on the CHTC correlations used. Therefore, for accurate predictions of the space cooling demand, adequate CHTC correlations have to be used adjusted to the actual building configuration. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The growth, reproduction and geographical distribution of plants are profoundly influenced by their physiological ecology: the interaction with the surrounding physical, chemical and biological environments. This textbook is notable in emphasizing that the mechanisms underlying plant physiological ecology can be found at the levels of biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology and whole-plant physiology. At the same time, the integrative power of physiological ecology is well-suited to assess the costs, benefits and consequences of modifying plants for human needs, and to evaluate the role of plants in ecosystems.Plant Physiological Ecology begins with the primary processes of carbon metabolism and transport, plant-water relations, and energy balance. After considering individual leaves and whole plants, these physiological processes are then scaled up to the level of the canopy. Subsequent chapters discuss mineral nutrition and the ways in which plants cope with nutrient-deficient or toxic soils. The book then looks at patterns of growth and allocation, life-history traits, and interactions between plants and other organisms. Later chapters deal with traits that affect decomposition of plant material and with plant physiological ecology at the level of ecosystems and global environmental processes.Plant Physiological Ecology features numerous boxed entries that provide extended discussions of selected issues, a glossary, and numerous references to the primary and review literature. The significant new text is suitable for use in plant ecology courses, as well as classes ranging from plant physiology to plant molecular biology.},

abstract = {We report a protocol using a common desk-top scanner and public domain software for measuring existing leaf area and leaf area removed as a result of herbivory. We compared the accuracy and precision of this method to that of a standard leaf area meter. Both methods were used to measure metal disks of a known area, the area of soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves, and the area removed by simulating leaf feeding with a hole-punch. We varied the amount of injury across a low, medium, and high degree of simulated feeding. The mean area of 10 cm2 and 50 cm2 metal disks was more accurately estimated with the leaf area meter than the desk-top scanner. Leaf area estimates from both methods were highly correlated. The desk-top scanner accurately estimated the leaf area removed from the low, medium, or high degree of simulated leaf feeding. However, the leaf area meter overestimated low levels of simulated feeding injury. Though measuring a leaf's surface area with a desk-top scanner requires two steps (creating a digital image file and calculating the area represented by that image), the overall time required to measure leaf injury is shorter than with a leaf area meter. This relatively simple and inexpensive method of estimating leaf area and feeding damage has advantages in certain experimental situations where a prefeeding measurement of the leaf is impossible or undesirable, or when small amounts of feeding occur.},

abstract = {A mathematical model for predicting human thermal and regulatory responses in cold, cool, neutral, warm, and hot environments has been developed and validated. The multi-segmental passive system, which models the dynamic heat transport within the body and the heat exchange between body parts and the environment, is discussed elsewhere. This paper is concerned with the development of the active system, which simulates the regulatory responses of shivering, sweating, and peripheral vasomotion of unacclimatised subjects. Following a comprehensive literature review, 26 independent experiments were selected that were designed to provoke each of these responses in different circumstances. Regression analysis revealed that skin and head core temperature affect regulatory responses in a nonlinear fashion. A further signal, i.e. the rate of change of the mean skin temperature weighted by the skin temperature error signal, was identified as governing the dynamics of thermoregulatory processes in the cold. Verification and validation work was carried out using experimental data obtained from 90 exposures covering a range of steady and transient ambient temperatures between 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C and exercise intensities between 46 W/m2 and 600 W/m2. Good general agreement with measured data was obtained for regulatory responses, internal temperatures, and the mean and local skin temperatures of unacclimatised humans for the whole spectrum of climatic conditions and for different activity levels.; },

@article{Gromke2008,
abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of flow and traffic exhaust dispersion in urban street canyons with avenue-like tree planting. The influence of tree planting with different crown porosity was investigated. Wind tunnel experiments for perpendicular approaching flow showed that avenue-like tree planting cause increases in exhaust concentrations at the leeward wall as tree crowns reduce the vortex found in the outer regions of the tree-free street canyon and the vertically entering volume flow rate at the canyon-roof top interface. This results in less ventilation and consequently larger concentrations in proximity of the leeward wall. At the windward wall, decreases in concentration are due to the upward moving stream in front of the leeward wall which extends farther into the skimming above roof flow and is better mixed. The clean air entrained in front of the windward wall mixes with air inside the street canyon leading to smaller concentrations. Experiments performed in the wind tunnel with different tree crown porosities did not indicate substantial changes in the flow and concentration fields. The porous model crowns investigated behaved almost like impermeable objects when arranged in a sheltered position and wind speeds are relatively small as in the street canyon. The above described experiments have been also investigated by means of numerical simulations with the CFD code FLUENT???, rarely applied to this type of problems. The standard k-?? turbulence model and the Reynolds Stress Model were used for flow while the Eulerian advection diffusion scheme has been used for dispersion. Both models reproduced qualitatively the main aspects found in wind tunnel experiments, even though they underestimated flow velocities. Improvement of CFD dispersion performance was obtained by increasing the diffusivity through the turbulent Schmidt number Sct. Overall we found that the k-?? model failed to capture the complex structure of dispersion process in the presence of tree planting as it would require unphysical low Sct values. On the other hand the RSM turbulence model agreed fairly well with experiments by slightly reducing the standard Sct. The results obtained in this work by combining wind tunnel experiments and CFD based simulations to investigate this novel aspect of research suggest ways to obtain quantitative information for assessment, planning and implementation of exposure mitigation using trees in urban street canyons. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The turbulence field of airflow behind a porous fence has significant impacts on the fence's shelter efficiency. We used particle image velocimetry to obtain detailed velocity measurements behind two-dimensional porous fence models in a wind tunnel simulation, and analyzed the turbulence fields revealed by these measurements. We tested fence models with 11 porosities: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, and analyzed seven typical fences. The reduction of mean streamwise velocity behind all fences increased with decreasing fence porosity, but created a corresponding increase in the mean vertical velocity component turbulence. We used vorticity, turbulence intensity, Reynolds stress, and turbulent kinetic energy to characterize the turbulence fields. Of these parameters, only the turbulence intensity is found to be directly related to the shelter efficiency of fences in terms of sediment transport on the surface because the magnitudes of the other parameters nearest the surface are insignificant. Vorticity causes loss of wind energy and tends to lift sediment particles carried by the wind passing over the fences to higher levels. It is found that flow reattachment behind fences is related to the high turbulence intensity nearest to the surface and high Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy in the layer right above. The optimal fence porosity we proposed in a previous study is found to be the critical porosity above which turbulence intensity and vertical velocity component are greatly reduced. Further research is required to make a comprehensive assessment of shelter efficiency of wind fences, taking account of the wind reduction and turbulence fields. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A damage pattern that is occasionally found after a period of strong winds shows an area of damaged trees inside a forest stand behind an intact stripe of trees directly at the windward edge. In an effort to understand the mechanism leading to this damage pattern, wind loading in the forest-edge region during passages of extreme gusts with different char-acteristics are investigated using a scaled forest model in the wind tunnel. The interaction of a transient extreme gust with the stationary atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) as a back-ground flow at the forest edge leads to the formation of a vortex at the top of the canopy. This vortex intensifies when travelling downstream and subsequently deflects high-momentum air from above the canopy downwards resulting in increased wind loading on the tree crowns. Under such conditions, the decrease in wind loading in the streamwise direction can be relatively weak compared to stationary ABL approach flows. The resistance of trees with streamwise distance from the forest edge, however, is the result of adaptive growth to wind loading under stationary flow conditions and shows a rapid decline within two to three tree heights behind the windward edge. For some of the extreme gusts realized, an exceedance of the wind loading over the resistance of the trees is found at approximately three tree heights behind the forest edge, suggesting that the damage pattern described above can be caused by the interaction of a transient extreme gust with the stationary ABL flow.},

abstract = {Because of high costs for pest control and of intensified concerns for environmental protection, the need for improvements in spray efficiency and for drift reduction are more critical than ever before. Inefficiencies in spray applications are related to a complex combination of factors, including environmental conditions, tree architecture, development stages as well as machine design, calibration and operation. Accurate prediction of airflow through a canopy is difficult due to the complexity in the structure of vegetation elements and the complex process of air momentum transport within the canopy. This further makes it difficult to analyse particle deposition on plant canopies and drift so as to optimize design and operation parameters to equipments. In this work a 3D orchard canopy structure is developed by means of a plant growth model, which considers the phenomenological plant growing behaviour and effects of temperature and pruning. The resulting canopy architecture is introduced into a CFD package in order to model the 3D airflow through the canopy. The real effects of the canopy on the airflow distribution are investigated. The simulations are used to identify simplified canopy models that can be used in drift prediction models, which are mainly based on porous media theory.},

abstract = {Stomata play a key role in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions as they control both water losses and CO2 uptake. Particularly, in the context of global change, simulations of the consequences of drought on crop plants are needed to design more efficient and water-saving cropping systems. However, most of the models of stomatal conductance (gs) developed at the leaf level link gs to environmental factors or net photosynthesis (Anet), but do not include satisfactorily the effects of drought, impairing our capacity to simulate plant functioning in conditions of limited water supply. The objective of this review was to draw an up-to-date picture of the gs models, from the empirical to the process-based ones, along with their mechanistic or deterministic bases. It focuses on models capable to account for multiple environmental influences with emphasis on drought conditions. We examine how models that have been proposed for well-watered conditions can be combined with those specifically designed to deal with drought conditions. Ideas for future improvements of gs models are discussed: the issue of co-regulation of gs and Anet; the roles of CO2, absissic acid and H2O2; and finally, how to better address the new challenges arising from the issue of global change.},

abstract = {Abstract The equations of motion were used to develop a one-dimensional, nonbuoyant mathematical model of air flow within vegetative canopies. The model consists of equations for mean horizontal momentum, Reynolds stress, and for the three components of turbulent kinetic energy with closure achieved by parameterizing the higher order terms. This eliminates the need to model the Reynolds stress directly using an eddy viscosity. The closure schemes rely upon a prescribed length scale and have been used elsewhere in modeling the atmospheric boundary layer free of vegetation. The equations were solved numerically using specified boundary conditions. Using a profile of plant area density for a crop of corn (Zea mays L.) the model predicted mean wind velocity, Reynolds stress and turbulent intensities for the region from the soil surface to twice the canopy height that compare well with experimental measurements (Shaw et al., 1974a,b).

abstract = {The effect of ventilation configuration of a tunnel greenhouse with crop on airflow and temperature patterns was numerically investigated using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The numerical model was firstly validated against experimental data collected in a tunnel greenhouse identical with the one used in simulations. The airflow patterns were measured and collected using a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and the greenhouse ventilation rate was deduced using a tracer gas technique. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between the numerical results and the experimental measurements. After its validation, the CFD model was used to study the consequences of four different ventilator configurations on the natural ventilation system. The ventilation configuration affects the ventilation rate of the greenhouse and the airflow and air temperature distributions as well. For the different configurations, computed ventilation rates varied from 10 to 58 air changes per hour for an outside wind speed of 3ms-1and for a wind direction perpendicular to the openings. Likewise, the simulations highlight that while the mean air temperature at the middle of the tunnels varied from 28{\textperiodcentered}2 to 29{\textperiodcentered}8°C, for an outside air temperature of 28°C, there are regions inside tunnels 6°C warmer than outside air. Average air velocity in the crop cover varied according to the arrangement of the vents from 0{\textperiodcentered}2 to 0{\textperiodcentered}7ms-1. The consequences of the marked climate heterogeneity on plant activity through the variation of crop aerodynamic resistance as well as the influence of the vent configurations on the efficiencies of ventilation on flow rate and air temperature differences between inside and outside, are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

abstract = {With considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. Both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. Regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. In order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) is based on the Munich Energy-balance Model for Individuals (MEMI), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. PET is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. This way PET enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. On hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the PET value may be more than 20 K higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 K lower.},

abstract = {One of the applications of remotely sensed surface temperature is to determine the latent heat flux (LE) or evapotranspiration (ET) from held to regional scales. A common approach has been to use surface-air temperature differences in a bulk resistance equation for estimating sensible beat flux, H, and to subsequently solve for LE as a residual in the one-dimensional energy balance equation. This approach has been successfully applied over uniform terrain with nearly full, actively transpiring vegetative cover; however, serious discrepancies between estimated and measured ET have been observed when there is partial canopy cover.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn an attempt to improve the estimates of H and as a result compute more accurate values of ET over partial canopy cover, one- and two-layer resistance models are developed to account for some of the factors causing the poor agreement between computed and measured ET.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe utility of these two approaches for estimating ET at the field scale is tested with remotely sensed and micrometeorological data collected in an and environment from a furrowed cotton field with 20 percent cover and a dry soil surface. The estimates of LE are compared with values measured using eddy correlation and energy balance methods. It is found that the one-layer model generally performed better than the two-layer model under thew conditions; but only when using a bluff-body correction to the resistance based on a conceptual model of beat and water vapor transfer at the surface taking place by molecular diffusion into Kolmogorov-scale eddies. The empirical adjustment to the surface resistance with the one-layer approach assumed to be applicable for a fairly wide range of conditions was found to be inappropriate. This result is attributed to the significant size of the furrows relative to the height of the vegetation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFurthermore, a sensitivity analysis showed that the one-layer model with the empirical adjustment for the resistance was significantly affected by the changes in the surface roughness, whereas the physically based bluff- body correction was relatively insensitive to thew variations. For the two-layer model, a large change in the input variable for computing soil evaporation had a relatively small impact on the computed fuxes while a significant change in the leaf area index appeared to amplify the deviations between measured and modeled LE-values.},

abstract = {Greening is a useful mitigation strategy for planners mainly from a visual perspective. For high-density urban living environment such as Hong Kong, urban greening helps cooling the air and providing shade; it also helps lowering building energy consumption by providing a better outdoor boundary condition. Many researchers have also suggested that greening may be employed as a strategy for combating the ill effects of urban Heat Island (UHI). Working towards a set of better greening guidelines for urban planners, the current paper first provides a comprehensive review of planning with urban greening. It then describes parametric studies that have been conducted to investigate the preferred location, amount, and types of vegetation for urban planning. The parametric studies employed the numerical model ENVI-met, verified using field measurements, to simulate 33 cases with different combinations of factors. For benefiting urban activities, ambient air temperatures at the pedestrian level are compared among different greening strategies and building heights. For a city such as Hong Kong, which has a high building-height-to-street-width (H/W) ratio, the present study reveals that roof greening is ineffective for human thermal comfort near the ground. Trees are also suggested to be more effective than grass surfaces in cooling pedestrian areas. The amount of tree planting needed to lower pedestrians level air temperature by around 1 ??C is approximately 33{\%} of the urban area. The present study allows urban planners to identify more precisely the greening principles, amount and policies necessary for better urban living environment in high-density cities. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Grasslands cover about 40{\%} of the ice-free global terrestrial surface, but their contribution to local and regional water and carbon fluxes and sensitivity to climatic perturbations such as drought remains uncertain. Here, we assess the direction and magnitude of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) and its components, ecosystem carbon assimilation (A(c)) and ecosystem respiration (R-E), in a southeastern United States grassland ecosystem subject to periodic drought and harvest using a combination of eddy-covariance measurements and model calculations. We modeled A(c) and evapotranspiration (ET) using a big-leaf canopy scheme in conjunction with ecophysiological and radiative transfer principles, and applied the model to assess the sensitivity of NEE and ET to soil moisture dynamics and rapid excursions in leaf area index (LAI) following grass harvesting. Model results closely match eddy-covariance flux estimations on daily, and longer, time steps. Both model calculations and eddy-covariance estimates suggest that the grassland became a net source of carbon to the atmosphere immediately following the harvest, but a rapid recovery in LAI maintained a marginal carbon sink during summer. However, when integrated over the year, this grassland ecosystem was a net C source (97 g C m(-2) a(-1)) due to a minor imbalance between large A(c) (-1,202 g C m(-2) a(-1)) and R-E (1,299 g C m(-2) a(-1)) fluxes. Mild drought conditions during the measurement period resulted in many instances of low soil moisture (theta{\textless}0.2 m(3)m(-3)), which influenced A(c) and thereby NEE by decreasing stomatal conductance. For this experiment, low theta had minor impact on R-E. Thus, stomatal limitations to A(c) were the primary reason that this grassland was a net C source. In the absence of soil moisture limitations, model calculations suggest a net C sink of -65 g C m(-2) a(-1) assuming the LAI dynamics and physiological properties are unaltered. These results, and the results of other studies, suggest that perturbations to the hydrologic cycle are key determinants of C cycling in grassland ecosystems.},

To measure the dynamic response of a sample tree, set within this model forest, a miniature, fast response strain-gauge balance was designed and built. Linked to a computer for on-line data sampling, this balance provided measurements of the fluctuating along-wind and across-wind components of the overturning moment at ground level, leading to values of mean and extreme moments and the frequency spectrum of the sway motion. Associated measurements of local wind flow characteristics were made with hot-wire anemometers and a laser anemometer. The response of the tree has the characteristics of classical lightly damped vibration and there is evidence that resonant sway motion increases the extreme overturning moments significantly above the values produced by wind gust forces alone.},

abstract = {Aim of study: We examined the impact of sustained partial throughfall exclusion on the functional performance of Buxus sempervirens L. in the understory of a Mediterranean evergreen forest. We further considered whether any impacts of throughfall exclusion were affected by light availability. Area of study: The study was conducted in the south of France. Material and methods: Several leaf physiological and branch structural traits were measured along a light gradient after seven years from the onset of a throughfall exclusion experiment (TEE). The results were analysed along with annual growth and survival data. Main results: Plant mortality was nil in both the throughfall exclusion and control treatments. Stem diameter growth was reduced by 39{\%} in plants subjected to throughfall exclusion, but this difference was only significant at the p = 0.10 significance level. Leaf physiology remained unaffected by the TEE, but small changes were evident in branch structural traits in high light microsites following throughfall exclusion; branches had lower wood density in the TEE plot, and more biomass was partitioned to leaves relative to stems. Research highlights: These changes do not seem to reflect an acclimatory response that would enhance drought tolerance. Instead, we suggest that these drought effects might exacerbate vulnerability to xylem cavitation in the more open microsites. Reduced growth and increased vulnerability to drought may indicate an incipient decline in plant vitality following TEE. The extension of observations to the whole-plant level and longer periods will elucidate the consequences of these observations for plant fitness, and permit verification of the positive effect of shade on Buxus sempervirens under increased drought.},

These poromechanical interactions play an important role in geological and biological systems across a wide range of scales, from the propagation of magma through the Earth's mantle to the transport of fluid through living cells and tissues. The theory of poroelasticity has been largely successful in modeling poromechanical behavior in relatively simple systems, but this continuum theory is fundamentally limited by our understanding of the pore-scale interactions between the fluid and the solid. In growing, melting, granular, and fibrous materials, these interactions can be extremely complex. Here, we present a high-resolution measurement of poromechanical deformation driven by fluid injection. We inject fluid into a dense, confined monolayer of soft particles and use particle tracking to reveal the dynamics of the multi-scale deformation field. While a continuum model based on a modification of conventional poroelastic theory captures certain macroscopic features of the deformation, the particle-scale deformation field exhibits dramatic departures from smooth, continuum behavior. We observe novel grain-scale plasticity and hysteresis, as well as petal-like mesoscale structures that are connected to material failure through spiral shear banding.},

We investigate here the effect of mechanical deformations of leaves due to wind or their own weight on this distribution. First, the specific role of the geometry of the tree is identified and shown to be weak, using models of idealized tree and tools of statistical mechanics. Then the deformation of individual leaves under gravity or wind is quantified experimentally. New dimensionless parameters are proposed, and used in simple models of these deformations. By combining models of tree geometry and models of leaf deformation, we explore the role of all mechanical parameters on the Leaf Inclination Angle Distributions. These are found to have a significant influence, which is exemplified finally in computations of direct light interception by idealized trees. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilised to investigate the flow characteristics around tree windbreaks. The efficiency of windbreaks depends on many factors which can be investigated in field experiments, though this is limited due to several reasons such as unstable weather conditions, few measuring points, etc. Fortunately, the investigation is possible via computer simulations. The simulation technique allows the trees to be modelled as a porous media where the aerodynamic properties of the trees are utilised in the model. The trees employed are Black pine trees (Pinus thunbergii) with a drag coefficient value of 0.55. The simulation provides analysis of the effect of gaps between trees, rows of trees, and tree arrangements in reducing wind velocity.The simulations revealed that 0.5. m gap between trees was more effective in reducing wind velocity than 0.75 and 1.0. m. The percentage reduction in velocity at the middle of the tree section for 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0. m gap distance was found to be 71, 65 and 56{\%}, respectively. Two-rows of alternating trees were also found to be more effective than one-row and two-rows of trees. The reduction at the middle of the tree region for one-row and two-rows of trees and two-rows arranged alternately was 71, 88 and 91{\%}, respectively.

abstract = {Accurate predictions of convective heat transfer are essential in building-engineering and environmental studies on urban heat islands, building energy performance, (natural) building and inter-building ventilation and building-envelope durability and conservation. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of these applications, wall functions are mostly used to model the boundary-layer region. Recently, an adjusted wall function for temperature (CWF) has been proposed (Defraeye et al., 2011a). This CWF was intended for forced-convective heat transfer at surfaces of bluff bodies, such as buildings in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This CWF provides increased (wall-function) accuracy for convective heat transfer predictions and can be easily implemented in existing CFD codes. As ABL flow around buildings is often in the mixed-convective regime, the CWF performance is evaluated for situations with mixed convection in this paper. The CWF accuracy for mixed convection ({\~{}}16{\%} for the convective heat transfer coefficient, CHTC) is also much better than standard wall functions ({\~{}}47{\%} for the CHTC), but is Richardson-number dependent. The CWF approach can therefore significantly improve the accuracy of forced- or mixed-convective heat transfer in large-scale building-engineering or environmental studies, which are bound to rely on wall functions, but where accurate convective heat transfer predictions are required. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the context of soil water flow modeling, root water uptake is often evaluated based on water potential difference between the soil and the plant (the water potential gradient approach). Root water uptake rate is modulated by hydraulic resistance of both the root itself, and the soil in the root vicinity. The soil hydraulic resistance is a function of actual soil water content and can be assessed assuming radial axisymmetric water flow toward a single root (at the mesoscopic scale). In the present study, three approximate solutions of mesoscopic root water uptake - finite difference approximation, steady-state solution, and steady-rate solution - are examined regarding their ability to capture the pressure head variations in the root vicinity. Insignificance of their differences when implemented in the macroscopic soil water flow model is demonstrated using the critical root water uptake concept. Subsequently, macroscopic simulations of coupled soil water flow and root water uptake are presented for a forest site under temperate humid climate. Predicted soil water pressure heads and actual transpiration rates are compared with observed data. Scenario simulations illustrate uncertainties associated with estimates of root geometrical and hydraulic properties. Regarding the actual transpiration prediction, the correct characterization of active root system geometry and hydraulic properties seems far more important than the choice of a particular mesoscopic model.},

In particular, it is important to test low-dissipative algorithms in unstructured codes of industrial relevance. In the present paper, the implementation of incompressible, explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) based projection methods into the OpenFOAM{\textregistered} library is discussed. We search for low-dissipative alternatives to the second order time integration methods which are commonly used together with the standard pressure correction approach PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators) in many commercial and open source codes including OpenFOAM{\textregistered}. The practical implementation of the projection methods in OpenFOAM{\textregistered} is provided together with theory. The method is tested with the classical fourth order RK-method and the accelerated third order RK-method. Four numerical experiments are carried out in order to cross-validate the solvers and in order to investigate the drawbacks/benefits of the solution approaches. The test problems are: (1) 2d lid driven cavity flow at Re=2500, (2) DNS of 3d turbulent channel flow at Re?=180, (3) LES of a 3d mixing layer, and (4) the 2d inviscid Taylor-Green vortex. The RK-methods are benchmarked against the standard OpenFOAM{\textregistered} LES/DNS solver based on the PISO pressure correction method. The results indicate that the RK projection methods provide low-dissipative alternatives to the PISO method. The turbulent test cases show also that the RK-methods have a good computational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This is accomplished by analyzing data gathered by automobile traverses in 10 settlements on the St. Lawrence Lowland, whose populations range from 1000 to 2 million inhabitants. The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities.},

Normalized sediment flux decreased with increasing height over a bare surface. However, plants affected the sediment transport system by modifying the vertical distribution of sediment flux within and above the vegetated surface. Sand flux reduced from low to high plant density below the plant height but this pattern reversed above the vegetated surface. Observations of the horizontal profiles of sand flux indicated sediment was transported within the vegetated areas of both plant types in all densities. In low density, the horizontal trend of sand flux was similar to the bare sand surface. In medium density, the sand flux increased slightly within the vegetated surface and decreased beyond the vegetated surface for both plant types. In high density, sediment flux increased from the upwind edge to the middle of the vegetation barrier, and reduced at the downwind end and beyond the vegetated surface of both plant types. Observations of sand flux in different plant densities revealed the influence of plant drag versus the turbulence produced by plants. At a certain distance within the vegetated area, plant drag reduced the sand flux. Although varying between the two plant types, sand flux decreased overall from unplanted to planted configurations.},

abstract = {Convective drying of an unsaturated porous flat plate at low Reynolds numbers (10 3) is analysed by means of conjugate modelling of heat and mass transport in the air flow and the porous material. Conjugate modelling does not require knowledge of convective transfer coefficients (CTCs) but allows determining the CTCs a posteriori, hence identifying their spatial and temporal variability, which is the main focus of this study. Comparison is made with porous-material modelling using spatially and/or temporally constant CTCs. Both spatial and temporal variations of the convective boundary conditions are found to have a distinct impact on the drying behaviour: the spatial CTC variation results in two-dimensional drying of the porous material due to leading-edge effects; the temporal CTC variation identifies distinct maxima in the drying rates at the surface right before the surface dries out locally. The CTCs obtained with conjugate modelling remain approximately constant during the constant and decreasing drying rate period (CDRP and DDRP, respectively), but a distinct variation is noticed at the transition of CDRP to DDRP. The heat and mass transfer analogy is found to be valid during the CDRP and to a lesser extent during the DDRP but large discrepancies are found during the transition of CDRP to DDRP. The advantages of conjugate modelling are indicated in this study but the need for detailed modelling of convective boundary conditions is however strongly dependent on the drying behaviour of the porous material and is not always required. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the past, stomatal responses have generally been considered in relation to single environmental variables in part because the interactions between factors have appeared difficult to quantify in a simple way. A linear correlation between stomatal conductance (g) and CO2 assimilation rate (A) has been reported when photon fluence was varied and when the photosynthetic capacity of leaves was altered by growth conditions, provided CO2, air humidity and leaf temperature were constant (1). Temperature and humidity are, however, not consistent in nature. Lack of a concise description of stomatal responses to combinations of environmental factors has limited attempts to integrate these responses into quantitative models of leaf energy balance, photosynthesis, and transpiration. Moreover, this lack has hindered progress toward understanding the stomatal mechanism. We have taken a multi-variant approach to the study of stomatal conductance and we show that under many conditions the responses of stornata can be described by a set of linear relationships. This model can be linked to models of leaf carbon metabolism and the environment to predict fluxes of CO2, H2O and energy. In this paper, we show how the model of conductance can be linked to a description of CO2 assimilation as a function of intercellular CO2 (whether empirical or the output of a model) to predict the distribution of flux control between the stornata and leaf ``biochemistry'' under conditions in a gas-exchange cuvette.},

abstract = {At day-times building fa??ades and ground surfaces are heated by solar radiation. Due to the increased surface temperatures, buoyancy is induced which changes the flow field around buildings significantly. Wind tunnel measurements were conducted to study the influence of buoyancy on the flow in a scaled urban street canyon with heated surfaces. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the flow field in a section of the street canyon. The two wall and the bottom surfaces of the street canyon were heated either individually or all together. A wide range of Froude numbers between 0.65 and 17.3 was covered with surfaces temperatures raised up to 70 ??C-130 ??C and freestream velocities between 0.68 m/s and 2.32 m/s. The velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) fields were analysed, and for some cases also the air temperatures inside the street canyon were measured. For most cases one main vortex is formed in the centre of the street canyon. This main vortex is strengthened, and the TKE inside the street canyon increased by, heating of (in order of importance) the ground, the leeward wall, and all three surfaces for low freestream velocities. For windward wall heating a second counter-rotating vortex is formed due to buoyancy and the flow direction close to the windward wall changes from a downward to an upward motion. The centres of the main and secondary vortex change their position for different windward wall temperatures with increasing freestream velocities. For low Froude numbers the air exchange rate is increased due to buoyancy. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and AimsLeaf transpiration is a key parameter for understanding land surface-climate interactions, plant stress and plant structure-function relationships. Transpiration takes place at the microscale level, namely via stomata that are distributed discretely over the leaf surface with a very low surface coverage (approx. 0{\textperiodcentered}2-5 {\%}). The present study aims to shed more light on the dependency of the leaf boundary-layer conductance (BLC) on stomatal surface coverage and air speed.MethodsAn innovative three-dimensional cross-scale modelling approach was applied to investigate convective mass transport from leaves, using computational fluid dynamics. The gap between stomatal and leaf scale was bridged by including all these scales in the same computational model (10(-5)-10(-1) m), which implies explicitly modelling individual stomata.Key ResultsBLC was strongly dependent on stomatal surface coverage and air speed. Leaf BLC at low surface coverage ratios (CR), typical for stomata, was still relatively high, compared with BLC of a fully wet leaf (hypothetical CR of 100 {\%}). Nevertheless, these conventional BLCs (CR of 100 {\%}), as obtained from experiments or simulations on leaf models, were found to overpredict the convective exchange. In addition, small variations in stomatal CR were found to result in large variations in BLCs. Furthermore, stomata of a certain size exhibited a higher mass transfer rate at lower CRs.ConclusionsThe proposed cross-scale modelling approach allows us to increase our understanding of transpiration at the sub-leaf level as well as the boundary-layer microclimate in a way currently not feasible experimentally. The influence of stomatal size, aperture and surface density, and also flow-field parameters can be studied using the model, and prospects for further improvement of the model are presented. An important conclusion of the study is that existing measures of conductances (e.g. from artificial leaves) can be significantly erroneous because they do not account for microscopic stomata, but instead assume a uniform distribution of evaporation such as found for a fully-wet leaf. The model output can be used to correct or upgrade existing BLCs or to feed into higher-scale models, for example within a multiscale framework.},

abstract = {The relation between wind-driven rain (WDR) and its potential negative effects on the hygrothermal performance and durability of building facades can be better understood by the correct estimation of the spatial and temporal distribution of the WDR intensity. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with Eulerian Multiphase (EM) modeling are used to obtain accurate spatial and temporal information on WDR. The EM model has the advantage of predicting the WDR intensity on all surfaces of a complex geometry within the domain at once. There is a lack of numerical studies on the WDR intensity in generic and idealized multi-building configurations. In this paper, WDR intensities on an array of 9 low-rise cubic building models for wind from three different wind directions are estimated numerically using the EM model including the turbulent dispersion of raindrops. The numerical results are validated by comparing the calculated catch ratio values with data from field measurements in D??bendorf, Switzerland after two rain events with different characteristics. The CFD simulations successfully estimate the WDR intensities at the positions of 18 WDR gauges for both rain events. The influence of turbulent dispersion is found to be lower than 3{\%} for both rain events. It is found that, for oblique wind directions, even though the maximum WDR intensity on the facades is lower, the whole building is exposed to up to 57{\%} more WDR. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Root system architecture (RSA) can significantly affect plant access to water, total transpiration, as well as its partitioning by soil depth, with implications for surface heat, water, and carbon budgets. Despite recent advances in land surface model (LSM) descriptions of plant hydraulics, descriptions of RSA have not been included because of their three-dimensional complexity, which makes them generally too computationally costly. Here we demonstrate a new, process-based 1D layered model that captures the dynamic shifts in water potential gradients of 3D RSA under different soil moisture conditions: the RSA stencil. Using root systems calibrated to the rooting profiles of four plant functional types (PFT) of the Community Land Model, we show that the RSA stencil predicts plant water potentials within 2{\%} to the outputs of a full 3D model, under the same assumptions on soil moisture heterogeneity, despite its trivial computational cost, resulting in improved predictions of water uptake and soil moisture compared to a model without RSA in a transient simulation. Our results suggest that LSM predictions of soil moisture dynamics and dependent variables can be improved by the implementation of this model, calibrated for individual PFTs using field observations.},

abstract = {Numerical heat-air-moisture (HAM) transfer models are increasingly being used to study the hygrothermal performance and the durability of building facades. One of the most important boundary conditions for HAM simulations is wind-driven rain (WDR). Due to the complexity of WDR, however, the current HAM models generally incorporate it in a very simplified way. Recent research has shown that CFD can provide quite accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of WDR on building facades. Therefore, in this paper, a combined CFD-HAM approach is presented. It consists of implementing catch-ratio charts resulting from CFD simulations into the HAM model. Within the model, these charts are used to convert the standard meteorological input data (wind speed, wind direction and horizontal rainfall intensity) into WDR distribution records that are used as boundary condition for the actual HAM simulations. The combined approach is demonstrated for a simplified wall model. It is shown that the accuracy of the HAM-simulation results is to a large extent determined by the time resolution of the meteorological input data and by the data-averaging technique used for these data. Some important guidelines for accurate HAM analyses with WDR are provided. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Building materials play an important role in the absorption, transport and storage of heat and moisture in the built environment. A fully-integrated urban microclimate model is proposed, which solves for wind flow and for the transport of heat and moisture in the air and building materials. The model includes long-wave and short-wave radiative exchange between surfaces and the distribution of wind-driven rain intensity. Transport in air and building materials are coupled in such a way that the steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) is solved iteratively with the unsteady heat and moisture transfer in building materials. The proposed approach provides the information required for analyzing different contributions of convective cooling, sensible heat transfer due to rain, evaporation, in addition to the thermal storage throughout the day. This approach is demonstrated with a case study investigating the impact of rain deposition on an isolated three-dimensional street canyon lined with porous building materials. The study shows different rate of evaporation and duration of evaporative cooling for a change in wind speed during a rain event. The distribution of wind-driven rain particularly influences the spatial and temporal distribution of surface and air temperatures. A significant influence of neighboring surfaces is found on the surface temperatures.},

abstract = {Vegetation and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating thermal load in urban areas. The goals of this study were to analyse species-specific microclimatic effects and to identify the role of leaf-area-density, transpiration, and stomatal conductance for cooling effects at urban sites. Air temperature, relative humidity and surface temperature were used to study the effects of six tree species with similar age structure in a residential area with comparable site conditions. Transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf-area density were measured during the summer months in 2013. Air temperatures and relative humidity were monitored for four trees per street in hourly intervals, and surface temperatures were recorded in the afternoon for three hot days on the shaded and unshaded asphalt surfaces beneath the trees.Species differ significantly in their ability to reduce air and surface temperatures, as well as to increase relative humidity. Trees showing both a high leaf-area density and a high rate of transpiration are more effective in cooling the air temperatures. Differences in the surface temperatures of the tree shaded areas are more pronounced compared to the air temperatures. Thus, the surface temperatures of the full sun exposed areas are up to 15.2. K warmer than that in the tree shaded areas. The results provide information to decrease thermal load in urban areas for future tree planting by choosing species with high cooling potential. The highest cooling potential was measured for Corylus colurna and Tilia cordata '. Greenspire' and the lowest for Ulmus × hollandica 'Lobel'.},

The model was independently tested against eddy-covariance fluxes of CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O and sensible heat measured above and within the canopy, and against soil heat flux and temperature and moisture profiles. The model was shown to well reproduce fluxes and resulting scalar gradients at diurnal and seasonal timescales. Also predictions for moss moisture content and soil moisture and temperature dynamics were acceptable considering the heterogeneity in soil hydraulic and thermal properties and uncertainties in boundary conditions.The model framework allows for (1) coupling above-ground with the soil domains through the feedbacks between soil water and vegetation mediated by the moss layer, (2) several vascular plant species or cohorts in a multi-species canopy, and (3) explicit treatment of bryophyte layer energy and water balance and bottom layer - atmosphere exchange. These features make APES well-suited for exploring feedbacks between boreal forest structure, site conditions and vegetation processes controlling ecosystem-atmosphere exchange.},

abstract = {Values of the total vertical flux of sensible and latent heat over a level forested region, obtained from aerodynamic (profile-gradient) formulae appropriate to airflow over relatively smooth surfaces, are found to fall consistently short of independent energy-balance estimates by a factor of 2 to 3 in unstable and near-neutral conditions (Richardson number, Ri, in the range -0.4 to +0.01), whereas for Ri {\textgreater} + 0.02 no similar discrepancy is detected.  These results, based on tangents drawn to (senii-logarithmic) profiles at a height of about nine aerodynan-dc roughness parameters (zo) above the zero plane displacement level (d) of the forest, rely on the basic assumption that the value of d established in very nearly neutral conditions (|Ril {\textless} 0.003), namely 0.76 mean tree heights, holds under all conditions of thermal stability.  Wake diffusion and thermal seeding effects are discussed as possible additional transfer mechanisms acting to reduce profile gradients immediately over aerodynamically rough surfaces.  In terms of the former mechanism (assumed to operate below d + 25zo, or so), approximate empirical formulae are derived which attempt to quantify the observed discrepancy in terms of Ri and the proximity of the surface.  It is concluded that aerodynamic equations ought not to be used to give independent flux estimates close to aerodynamically rough surfaces.},

abstract = {A comparative study of turbulence in a wind-tunnel model canopy is performed, using Large eddy simulation (LES) and experimental data from PIV and hot-wire anemometry measurements. The model canopy is composed of thin cylindrical stalks. In the LES, these are represented using a plant-scale approach, while the scale-dependent Lagrangian dynamic model is used as subgrid-scale model. LES predictions of turbulence statistics and energy spectra are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets from the LES simulation are analyzed to provide more information absent in the measurements. Results confirm that sloshing motions at the low levels of the canopy are mainly driven by pressure fluctuations. A difference between the energy flux obtained from the energy spectrum and the SGS dissipation rate is observed, consistent with a spectral bypass mechanism in which the real spectral flux due to cascade is smaller than that implied by the energy-spectrum level, due to direct drain by the canopy.},

This may in fact be true for incompressible flows when advective, rather than conservative, weak forms are employed.

It is shown here that this deficiency can be easily remedied, and conservative procedures for advective forms can be developed from multiscale concepts.

Validation is carried out by comparing simulation results with other reference simulations and experiments. For the hydrodynamic field, the wake structure was analyzed by means of the wake recirculation length for both steady and unsteady two-dimensional regimes, by comparing the Strouhal number of the vortex shedding associated with the first instability of the hydrodynamic field, and qualitatively by showing the streamlines for different Reynolds numbers. For the thermal part of the simulations, isotherms and mean Nusselt number are qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the literature results. All the computed quantities are found to agree excellently with the reference data available in the literature.

abstract = {The heterogeneity of crop transpiration is important to clearly understand the microclimate mechanisms and to efficiently handle the water resource in greenhouses. A computational fluid dynamic software (CFD2000) was used to study the climate and crop transpiration distributions in a 22 ?? 8 m2 plastic tunnel situated in Avignon, France, together with a global solar radiation model and a crop heat exchange model. The distribution of solar radiation within the greenhouse tunnel was determined based on the path of the sun, the greenhouse geometry, the cover transmittance and the sky conditions. The crop transpiration was deduced by assimilating the crop to a porous medium exchanging latent and sensible heats with its environment. The radiative and convective heterogeneity in two vertical sections of the tunnel predicted by the CFD model was validated against the experimental results obtained by a group of solar cells and sonic anemometers. The validated model was finally used to predict the transpiration flux of a mature lettuce crop in the tunnel. The crop transpiration strongly varied (up to 30{\%}) according to the place in the tunnel. The predicted crop transpiration was in close agreement with the measured value both along the sections with the side openings and between the consecutive openings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@phdthesis{Saneinejad2013,
abstract = {Due to global warming and the tendency towards urbanization, the Urban Heat Island Eect (UHI) is becoming more important in the recent years. The UHI refers to higher temperatures observed in the populated cities in comparison to their rural hinterland. The UHI will result in higher cooling demand by buildings in addition to more negative inuence on human health and comfort. One of the proposed methods for mitigating the UHI is evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling involves evaporation of moisture from a surface, a process which requires energy, and therefore results in lower air and surface temperatures. In an urban area, evaporation can occur from wet urban surfaces, urban ponds or lakes, vegetation, etc. In this thesis, the focus lies on evaporation from wet building surfaces, after a rain shower, and how evaporative cooling inuences the conditions in the street canyon. To do this, a model is proposed which couples three individual sub-models: a Computational Fluid Dynamics model (CFD) which solves the convective heat, air and moisture transport in the air, a Building Envelope Heat and Moisture (BE-HAM) model which solves the heat and moisture transport within the porous material, and a radiation model (RAD) which solves the radiative balance for short-wave and long-wave radiative exchange between the building surfaces and the sky. The proposed coupled model is used to evaluate the eect of evaporative cooling in a street canyon. Inuence of temperature and relative humidity of the environment, wind speed as well as the material, thickness, color and position of the wet surface, on the cooling potential of the street canyon are evaluated. The cooling potential is evaluated by studying the comfort of a human in a street canyon using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Our studies show that the thermal comfort in the street canyon is the lowest (UTCI is highest) when low wind speeds are experienced. Buoyancy near the windward wall results in entrapment of air in the canyon, less ventilation, hence more uncomfortable conditions. The evaporative cooling potential is found to be higher when wind speeds are low. Results also shows that during a heat wave, when uncomfortable conditions are experienced due to high temperature and relative humidity in the air, evaporative cooling is not as eective as during a hot summer day. This is due to the fact that evaporation results in a large increase of vapour pressure, which cancels out the evaporative cooling eect of lower air and mean radiant temperature.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis provides users of mathematical and simulation models with tools to appreciate the dependency of the model output from model input and to investigate how important is each model input in determining its output. All application areas are concerned, from theoretical physics to engineering and socio-economics. This introductory paper provides the sensitivity analysis aims and objectives in order to explain the composition of the overall “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter of the Springer Handbook. It also describes the basic principles of sensitivity analysis, some classification grids to understand the application ranges of each method, a useful software package, and the notations used in the chapter papers. This section also offers a succinct description of sensitiv- ity auditing, a new discipline that tests the entire inferential chain including model development, implicit assumptions, and normative issues and which is recommended when the inference provided by the model needs to feed into a regulatory or policy process. For the “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter, in addition to this introduction, eight papers have been written by around twenty practitioners from different fields of application. They cover the most widely used methods for this subject: the deterministic methods as the local sensitivity analysis, the experimental design strategies, the sampling-based and variance-based methods developed from the 1980s, and the new importance measures and metamodel- based techniques established and studied since the 2000s. In each paper, toy examples or industrial applications illustrate their relevance and usefulness.},

abstract = {Coupled modeling of fruit drying, deformation and quality evolution of a half-circular apple fruit slice is combined with modeling of the convective heat and mass exchange with the airflow. The aim was to gain more insight in the fruit drying kinetics, more particular in heterogeneities and couplings in moisture content and shrinkage as well as quality loss within the fruit during drying. Further aims were to investigate the impact of several modeling assumptions and to analyze the effect of the peel on the drying behavior. Large differences in internal moisture distribution and deformation were observed within the fruit slice. They were caused by the complex airflow field around the slice, which induced a spatial variation in convective heat/mass transfer coefficients (CTCs) over the fruit surface. The differences with imposing a single, constant CTC across the fruit surface (non-conjugate approach) indicated the need for including spatially-resolved CTCs (conjugate approach). The impact of including deformation in the model was also quantified. Not accounting for explicit airflow modeling or deformation affected the fruit temperature, and thereby also the fruit quality decay. The presence of a peel affected the drying process and the deformation, resulting in an asymmetrical collapse towards the center of the fruit slice. Coupling the modeled hygrothermal history of the fruit during drying, to fruit quality modeling opens new opportunities for optimizing drying processes. Thereby, the process can be optimized not only in terms of drying time or energy consumption, but also to achieve the best product quality.},

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with locally applied vegetation in the street, i.e. avenue-trees, facade greening, roof greening and all three combined, were performed. The 3D steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were closed by the realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model extended with source and sink terms to represent the effects of vegetation on air flow. By specifying a cooling power term in the energy equation, the transpirational cooling by vegetation was accounted for. The strongest cooling by a single vegetative measure was obtained with the avenue-trees with mean and maximum temperature reductions at pedestrian level of 0.43 °C and 1.6 °C, respectively. Facade greening resulted in rather small changes with mean and maximum reductions of 0.04 °C and 0.3 °C, respectively. For roof greening no noticeable reductions inside the canyon were found. In the case of a combination of all vegetative measures, cooling in terms of spatial distribution and intensity overall resembled a linear superposition of those of the vegetative measures solely applied with 0.52 °C mean and 2.0 °C maximum temperature reduction. Overall, the cooling was restricted to the vicinity of the vegetative measures, i.e. up to a distance of a few meters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the past decades the portion of the population living in urban areas has continuously increased. Due to the high building density, the microclimate in urban areas changes significantly compared to rural areas. The temperatures measured in urban areas are higher compared to the rural temperatures due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Furthermore, the longwave and solar radiation exchanges are influenced by shadowing, reflections between buildings and reduced sky view factors. The local urban microclimate has an influence on the energy demand of buildings and on human comfort and health in urban areas. In summer the human comfort in urban areas can decrease due to higher air and surface temperatures and lower wind speeds compared to rural areas. The local urban microclimate is difficult to predict because of the complex interaction of physical phenomena across a large range of time and length scales. Few guidelines exist for architects to mitigate UHI effects or its impacts. The aim of this paper is to model the urban microclimate with CFD and building energy simulations and to investigate in detail the influence of different urban building morphologies on the urban microclimate. This approach and the results of this study can be used to find measures to mitigate the UHI effect. The results show that building fa{\c{c}}ade surface temperatures are mainly influenced by the distance between buildings. For urban morphologies with similar surface temperatures, the air temperatures can still strongly vary due to different wind flow patterns causing different rates of removing heat by wind.},

abstract = {Our objective is to describe a multi-layer model of C sub(3)-canopy processes that effectively simulates hourly CO sub(2) and latent energy (LE) fluxes in a mixed deciduous Quercus-Acer (oak-maple) stand in central Massachusetts, USA. The key hypothesis governing the biological component of the model is that stomatal conductance (g sub(s)) is varied so that daily carbon uptake per unit of foliar nitrogen is maximized within the limitations of canopy water availability. The hydraulic system is modelled as an analogue to simple electrical circuits in parallel, including a separate soil hydraulic resistance, plant resistance and plant capacitance for each canopy layer. Stomatal opening is initially controlled to conserve plant water stores and delay the onset of water stress. Stomatal closure at a threshold minimum leaf water potential prevents xylem cavitation and controls the maximum rate of water flux through the hydraulic system. We show a strong correlation between predicted hourly CO sub(2) exchange rate (r super(2) = 0.86) and LE (r super(2) = 0.87) with independent whole-forest measurements made by the eddy correlation method during the summer of 1992. Our theoretical derivation shows that observed relationships between CO sub(2) assimilation and LE flux can be explained on the basis of stomatal behaviour optimizing carbon gain, and provides an explicit link between canopy structure, soil properties, atmospheric conditions and stomatal conductance.},

@article{Burgmann2009,
abstract = {The flow field in the respiratory and vascular system is known to be influenced by the flexibility of the walls. However, up to now, most of the experimental biofluidic investigations have been performed in rigid models due to the complexity and necessity of optical access. In this paper, a facility and measurement techniques for studying oscillating and pulsatile flow in elastic vessels will be described. The investigated vessel models have been adapted such that fluid-mechanical and structure-mechanical characteristics represent realistic blood flows in medium blood vessels. That is, characteristic parameters, i.e., the Reynolds and Womersley number, as well as mechanical properties of the flexible wall, i.e., the Young's modulus and the material compliance, have been chosen to reasonably represent realistic flow conditions. First, a method to manufacture elastic models, which mimic the structure-mechanical properties of vascular vessels is described. The models possess a tunable compliance and are made of transparent polydimethylsiloxane. Second, the experimental setup of the flow facility will be elucidated. The flow facility allows to mimic pulsatile flow at physiologically relevant Reynolds and Womersley numbers. The precise form of the flow cycle can individually be controlled. Water/glycerine is used as flow medium for refractive index matching particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The PIV recordings not only allow to assess the mean cross-sectional flow field but also further enable to simultaneously detect the movement of the flexible wall. Additionally, the local wall-shear stress can be obtained from the single-pixel line resolved near-wall flow field. To confirm the flow conditions of the oscillatory laminar flow inside the flow facility and to evaluate the ability to assess the flow field, measurements in a straight, uniform diameter, rigid Plexiglas pipe under identical conditions to those of the oscillating flow in the flexible vessel have been performed. The measurements of oscillating flow in the rigid pipe corroborate the experimentally obtained flow field and the wall-shear stress to well confirm Womersley's analytical solution and thereby evidence the quality of the flow facility and of the measurement techniques. To further study the detectability of the vessel deformation, oscillating flow at Reynolds numbers based on the non-dilated vessel diameter D and peak velocities Re  D  ranging from 1,000 to 1,750 and at Womersley numbers $\alpha$ ranging from 5 to 17.5 has been investigated in an elastic vessel.},

abstract = {Urban impervious surfaces convert precipitation to stormwater runoff, which causes water quality and quantity problems. While traditional stormwater management has relied on gray infrastructure such as piped conveyances to collect and convey stormwater to wastewater treatment facilities or into surface waters, cities are exploring green infrastructure to manage stormwater at its source. Decentralized green infrastructure leverages the capabilities of soil and vegetation to infiltrate, redistribute, and otherwise store stormwater volume, with the potential to realize ancillary environmental, social, and economic benefits. To date, green infrastructure science and practice have largely focused on infiltration-based technologies that include rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavements. However, a narrow focus on infiltration overlooks other losses from the hydrologic cycle, and we propose that arboriculture – the cultivation of trees and other woody plants – deserves additional consideration as a stormwater control measure. Trees interact with the urban hydrologic cycle by intercepting incoming precipitation, removing water from the soil via transpiration, enhancing infiltration, and bolstering the performance of other green infrastructure technologies. However, many of these interactions are inadequately understood, particularly at spatial and temporal scales relevant to stormwater management. As such, the reliable use of trees for stormwater control depends on improved understanding of how and to what extent trees interact with stormwater, and the context-specific consideration of optimal arboricultural practices and institutional frameworks to maximize the stormwater benefits trees can provide.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier LtdRows of trees have been naturally used as wind and snow fences to reduce strong winds, to prevent soil erosion and mitigate snow/sand drifts. Trees, composed of multi-scale fractal structures, modify the airflow through and around them in a complicated manner. This research investigates how engineered porous fences, designed using a typical multi-scale fractal structure, would change the wake characteristics and subsequently reshape the wind shelter effects. A two-dimensional (2D) fractal fence composed of cross-grid type fractal struts, along with an one-dimensional (1D) fractal fence, were tested using a planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) method in a boundary-layer wind tunnel. Wakes and shelter effects of two fractal fences are compared to those of the non-fractal fence model of the same height, length, bottom gap and porosity of 50{\%}. Results of the 2D fractal fence show a clear favorable shelter effect - the extended sheltered area of 1.5–4 times the fence height with the shelter parameter of 0.4, about 70{\%} longer than that of the non-fractal fence provides. Multi-scale fractal fences may potentially be adopted to transform the porous fence design by allowing tuning of the arrangement of struts, an additional set of parameters besides fence height, length and porosity.},

abstract = {Water flow from soil to plants depends on the properties of the soil next to roots, the rhizosphere. Although several studies showed that the rhizosphere has different properties than the bulk soil, effects of the rhizosphere on root water uptake are commonly neglected. To investigate the rhizosphere's properties we used neutron radiography to image water content distributions in soil samples planted with lupins during drying and subsequent rewetting. During drying, the water content in the rhizosphere was 0.05 larger than in the bulk soil. Immediately after rewetting, the picture reversed and the rhizosphere remained markedly dry. During the following days the water content of the rhizosphere increased and after 60 h it exceeded that of the bulk soil. The rhizosphere's thickness was approximately 1.5 mm. Based on the observed dynamics, we derived the distinct, hysteretic and time-dependent water retention curve of the rhizosphere. Our hypothesis is that the rhizosphere's water retention curve was determined by mucilage exuded by roots. The rhizosphere properties reduce water depletion around roots and weaken the drop of water potential towards roots, therefore favoring water uptake under dry conditions, as demonstrated by means of analytical calculation of water flow to a single root. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Temperature control of fresh produce by forced convective cooling through ventilated packaging is essential to preserve quality in postharvest supply chains. The challenge is to achieve uniform cooling of fruit in the entire cargo. Most numerical research using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) focused on ventilated packaging with relatively small ensembles of fruit. This study aims to gain more insight into the thermal heterogeneity and the associated differences in quality evolution for large ensembles of packed fruit, by investigating the thermal behavior of an entire pallet of fruit throughout the entire cold chain. To this end, the virtual cold chain method is applied, which virtually tracks the temperature–time history of individual fruit using CFD and accordingly predicts fruit quality evolution using kinetic rate law models. The pallet includes 80 cartons, in which 5120 fruit are explicitly modelled as discrete spheres. Three cold chain scenarios are evaluated. For all the three unit operations in a cold chain (precooling, transport and storage), significant differences in the fruit cooling time are found along the airflow direction, where the blockage of local vent holes is found to increase the thermal heterogeneity. Cooling heterogeneity is the smallest for precooling and the largest for cold storage. Fruit in upstream cartons also show a higher cooling heterogeneity than those in downstream cartons. The difference in quality evolution between individual fruit is found to be very limited if proper precooling is applied in the cold chain. In the cold chain without precooling, about 23{\%} more quality loss is found than in that with precooling. Ambient loading is promising to remove field heat during refrigerated transport.},

abstract = {Although trees are numerous in urban areas, their dynamic effects on the wind flow are usually approximated or neglected altogether in many wind engineering studies, especially those based on numerical modeling. This study investigates the effect of the inclusion of trees in numerical simulations of wind flow in urban area. Three approaches are used to include the dynamic effect of trees: the basic approach (tree effects are neglected), the implicit approach (tree effects are included in the surface parameterizations), and the explicit approach (trees are represented by porous media). Several test cases have been adopted in order to cover a wide range of urban complexities, wind directions, foliage densities, and tree planting configurations. The results show that there are significant effects of trees when the explicit approach is used compared to the basic and the implicit approaches. Thus tree effects need to be considered using an explicit approach to simulate wind flow in urban area. Also, many parameters such as wind direction, foliage density, and urban configuration are believed to influence the intensity of trees effects. This study emphasizes the importance to explicitly consider the effects of trees in numerical model investigations for the wind flow in urban areas.},

abstract = {Urban heat islands affect the energy use for cooling in an urban environment, as well as human comfort and health. Water evaporation from moist surfaces could potentially reduce the local temperature in urban areas, a process known as evaporative cooling. This paper introduces a coupled model to study the effect of evaporative cooling on the temperature conditions in an urban street canyon. A computational model for determining convective heat and mass exchanges between the canyon walls and the air is proposed. The model couples three sub-models: (i) a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, which solves heat and vapor transfer in the air, (ii) a Building Envelope Heat and Moisture (BE-HAM) transport model which solves heat and moisture transfer within the porous building walls and (iii) a radiation model (RAD) which determines the radiative heat exchange between the surfaces. An efficient coupling strategy has been developed and applied to investigate the drying of a wet windward wall of a street canyon. The effect of evaporation on the reduction of the surface and air temperatures in a street canyon is analyzed and the influence of these temperature reductions on the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) is shown to be important. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The pattern of flow through a porous windbreak has been investigated numerically using several well-known closure schemes (turbulence models). The shelter is included as a momentum extraction term in the streamwise momentum equation, for a fence having the value where kr is the pressure-loss coefficient of the fence, ū is the local mean horizontal (x) velocity, $\delta$(x,0) is the delta function and s(z,H) is a unit step function which is zero for heights (z) greater than the fence height, H. Previous experiments on neutrally stratified surface-layer flow through a porous fence were numerically simulated. Very good agreement with the observed velocity deficit in the near wake (x ⩽ 15H where H = fence height) of the fence was obtained using a Reynolds-stress closure scheme. The predictions of the “k-ϵ” closure scheme (which includes turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate equations to estimate the eddy viscosity) and the simplest scheme tested, eddy viscosity eddy viscosity at all downwind distances equal to its value far upstream where k = von Karman's constant, ) were only slightly less satisfactory. Satisfactory estimates of the pattern of turbulent kinetic energy behind the fence were obtained. All simulations failed to predict the sharp speedup observed over the fence, and consequently yielded a slower rate of recovery towards equilibrium than observed. Attempts to improve prediction of the speed-over and the far wake by including corrections for mean streamline curvature were unsuccessful. Design aids for isolated windbreaks have been generated from the prediction of the second-order closure model. These give the velocity reduction to be expected in the near wake of the fence and the drag on the fence for a range of values of the fence pressure-loss coefficient, krmr.},

abstract = {A numerical model was developed to simulate neutrally stratified air flow over and through a forest edge. The spatially averaged equations for turbulent flow in vegetation canopies are derived as the governing equations. A first-order closure scheme with the capability of accounting for the bulk momentum transport process in vegetation canopies is employed. The averaged equations are solved numerically by a fractional time-step method and successive relaxation. The asymptotic solution in time is regarded as the steady-state solution. Comparisons of model output to the field measurements of Raynor (1971) indicate that the model provides a realistic mean flow. Momentum balance computations show that the pressure gradient induced by the wind blowing against the forest edge is significant and has the same order of magnitude as the drag force in the edge region. The edge effect involves the generation of drag forces, the appearance of a large pressure gradient, the upward deflection of mean flow and the transport of momentum into the edge of the canopy},

@article{Allegrini2015,
abstract = {In the past decades cities have been continuously growing. The microclimate in urban areas differs significantly from the microclimate in rural areas. The temperatures in urban areas are most of the time higher due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect and the wind speeds are lower due to wind sheltering. The local microclimate strongly influences the space cooling and heating demand of buildings and the human comfort and health in urban areas. The mechanisms causing the UHI effect have to be understood in detail to be able to improve the sustainability of (future) cities and the human comfort in urban areas. Wind driven ventilation is one of the most efficient ways of removing heat from urban areas. Knowledge of the heat fluxes caused by wind driven ventilation is important to be able to optimize the design of urban areas in terms of heat removal. The heat removal by wind and buoyancy can be increased by choosing optimal building geometries. In this study the urban heat fluxes are studied for six generic urban morphologies. Coupled CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and building energy simulations are conducted. This approach has the advantage of having highly spatially resolved temperature and flow fields and therefore being able of determining heat fluxes. Turbulent and convective heat fluxes are considered. The results show the importance of buoyancy for low wind speed cases and the strong influence of buildings upstream on the heat fluxes and temperatures further downstream.},

@article{Krayenhoff2014,
abstract = {A neighbourhood-scale multi-layer urban canopy model of shortwave and longwave radiation exchange that explicitly includes the radiative effects of tall vegetation (trees) is presented. Tree foliage is permitted both between and above buildings, and mutual shading, emission and reflection between buildings and trees are included. The basic geometry is a two-dimensional canyon with leaf area density profiles and probabilistic variation of building height. Furthermore, the model accounts for three-dimensional path lengths through the foliage. Ray tracing determines the receipt of direct shortwave irradiance by building and foliage elements. View factors for longwave and shortwave diffuse radiation exchange are computed once at the start of the simulation using a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach; for subsequent model timesteps, matrix inversion rapidly solves infinite reflections and interception of emitted longwave between all elements. The model is designed to simulate any combination of shortwave and longwave radiation frequency bands, and to be portable to any neighbourhood-scale urban canopy geometry based on the urban canyon. Additionally, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent forest and forest-clearing scenarios. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate the model is robust and computationally feasible, and highlight the importance of vertical resolution to the performance of urban canopy radiation models. Full model evaluation is limited by the paucity of within-canyon radiation measurements in urban neighbourhoods with trees. Where appropriate model components are tested against analytic relations and results from an independent urban radiation transfer model. Furthermore, system response tests demonstrate the ability of the model to realistically distribute shortwave radiation among urban elements as a function of built form, solar angle and tree foliage height, density and clumping. Separate modelling of photosynthetically-active and near-infrared shortwave bands is shown to be important in some cases. Increased canyon height-to-width ratio and/or tree cover diminishes the net longwave radiation loss of individual canyon elements (e.g., floor, walls), but, notably, has little effect on the net longwave loss of the whole urban canopy. When combined with parametrizations for the impacts of trees on airflow and hydrological processes in the urban surface layer, the new radiation model extends the applicability of urban canopy models and permits more robust assessment of trees as tools to manage urban climate, air quality, human comfort and building energy loads.},

It is well suited to the evaluation of the thermal component of different climates. As well as having a detailed physiological basis, PET is preferable to other thermal indexes like the predicted mean vote because of its unit ( degrees C), which makes results more comprehensible to urban or regional planners, for example, who are not so familiar with modern human-biometeorological terminology. PET results can be presented graphically or as bioclimatic maps. Graphs mostly display the temporal behaviour of PET, whereas spatial distribution is specified in bioclimatic maps. In this article, some applications of PET are discussed. They relate to the evaluation of the urban heat island in cities in both temperate climates and warm climates at high altitude. The thermal component of the microclimate in the trunk space of a deciduous forest is also evaluated by PET. As an example of the spatial distribution of PET, a bioclimatic map for Greece in July (Mediterranean climate) is presented.},

abstract = {Existing procedures for the assessment of the thermal environment in the fields of public weather services, public health systems, precautionary planning, urban design, tourism and recreation and climate impact research exhibit significant shortcomings. This is most evident for simple (mostly two-parameter) indices, when comparing them to complete heat budget models developed since the 1960s. ISB Commission 6 took up the idea of developing a Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) based on the most advanced multi-node model of thermoregulation representing progress in science within the last three to four decades, both in thermo-physiological and heat exchange theory. Creating the essential research synergies for the development of UTCI required pooling the resources of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of thermal physiology, mathematical modelling, occupational medicine, meteorological data handling (in particular radiation modelling) and application development in a network. It was possible to extend the expertise of ISB Commission 6 substantially by COST (a European programme promoting Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action 730 so that finally over 45 scientists from 23 countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, several Europe countries, New Zealand, and the United States) worked together. The work was performed under the umbrella of the WMO Commission on Climatology (CCl). After extensive evaluations, Fiala's multi-node human physiology and thermal comfort model (FPC) was adopted for this study. The model was validated extensively, applying as yet unused data from other research groups, and extended for the purposes of the project. This model was coupled with a state-of-the-art clothing model taking into consideration behavioural adaptation of clothing insulation by the general urban population in response to actual environmental temperature. UTCI was then derived conceptually as an equivalent temperature (ET). Thus, for any combination of air temperature, wind, radiation, and humidity (stress), UTCI is defined as the isothermal air temperature of the reference condition that would elicit the same dynamic response (strain) of the physiological model. As UTCI is based on contemporary science its use will standardise applications in the major fields of human biometeorology, thus making research results comparable and physiologically relevant.},

The influence of the permeability, the shape, the sizes, the wake ventilation are discussed and new designs are suggested: for instance, the association of two wind breaks seems to be very good; the high horizontal speed gradient at the corner can be easily reduced as can the overspeed, etc. In fact, depending both upon the comfort level people want and upon the area (downstream) the "best" protection will not be given by the same wind break aerodynamics.

abstract = {This thesis aims on establishing more accurate and detailed predictions of convective heat and mass transfer at exterior building surfaces. A first part of this work focuses on fluid-side convective heat transfer at surfaces of buildings for forced-convective high-Reynolds number flow in the atmospheric boundary layer. The convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) is analysed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), by using validated steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, combined with low-Reynolds number modelling (LRNM) to resolve the boundary- layer region. The heat transport in the boundary layer, the spatial distribution of the CHTC over the building surfaces, its correlation with the wind speed and the influence of wind direction and buoyancy on the CHTC are investigated. Furthermore, several approaches to enhance numerical modelling of CHTCs with CFD are developed, such as an improved temperature wall function and the use of low wind speeds to determine CHTC-wind speed correlations for LRNM purposes, based on Reynolds number independence of the flow field. In addition, a methodology is proposed to determine the temporally-averaged CHTC for a building surface over a long time span, with which a significant dependency of this CHTC on the building surface orientation and the local wind climate is identified. In order to account simultaneously for heat and mass transport in the air flow and in porous materials, a conjugate heat and mass transfer model is developed in a second part of this work, which does not require a-priori knowledge of convective transfer coefficients (CTCs), where they can be determined a-posteriori. Conjugate modelling of convective drying of a porous material identifies a distinct spatial and temporal variability of these CTCs, where also the validity of the heat and mass transfer analogy is verified. Conjugate modelling thereby shows significant advantages regarding convective transfer assessment, compared to the use of CTCs. Furthermore, a conjugate convective drying experiment is performed and compared with numerical simulations, indicating the need for detailed conjugate experiments for validation of conjugate models as well as porous-material models. Moreover, the propagation of uncertainties in material properties on the porous-material modelling results for convective drying is investigated by stochastic analysis, which identifies a distinct sensitivity of the drying behaviour to these material transport properties.},

After penetrating the sample, neutrons were converted to light by a fluorescent converter and the resulting photons were counted by a cooled CCD camera. Taking the projection images at different angles of the samples, CT images as well as simple projection images were constructed. It is seen here, for the first time, that water is significantly concentrated within the first 1 mm from the root surface in all three kinds of the plants.

abstract = {The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) aimed for a one-dimensional quantity adequately reflecting the human physiological reaction to the multi-dimensionally defined actual outdoor thermal environment. The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following the concept of an equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50{\%} relative humidity (but vapour pressure capped at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin wettedness, skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid. The analyses of the sensitivity of UTCI to humidity, radiation and wind speed showed plausible reactions in the heat as well as in the cold, and indicate that UTCI may in this regard be universally useable in the major areas of research and application in human biometeorology.},

These relationships differ depending on the type of leaf (amphistomatous or with stomata on only one side) and on the way the reference leaves are wetted (on either both sides or on one side only). Because of ambiguous assumptions on the wetting process and small inaccuracies in the calculation of some resistances, these basic relationships are not clear.

abstract = {A simplified numerical model for rainwater runoff on building facades is presented, evaluated and discussed. The variation of runoff film thickness is described by a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation. This equation is derived from the continuity equation, to which the wind-driven rain (WDR) intensity and the capillary absorption flux by the wall are added as source/sink terms, and from the adoption of the parabolic velocity profile of the Nusselt solution for a simplified representation of thin film flow. Two major model simplifications are the adoption of the Nusselt solution for (1) statistically-steady, developed films, in spite of actual wave behaviour, and for (2) transient, developing films, in spite of the actual moving contact line complexity. Both simplifications are directly related to surface tension effects. Concerning the first simplification, a selective review of the literature, including experimental laboratory data, confirms the validity of the Nusselt solution for representing the time-averaged properties of thin film flow, up to film Reynolds numbers of 1000, in spite of the actual wave behaviour. Concerning the second simplification, the runoff model is evaluated by a comparison with available on-site measurements of rainwater runoff from a building facade exposed to WDR, indicating a fair qualitative and quantitative agreement. Specific attention is given to a discussion of the possibilities and limitations of the runoff model. The runoff model can easily be integrated into 2D and 3D building envelope heat-air-moisture transfer (BE-HAM) models, but further research on the simplifications and assumptions of the runoff model is required. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the neutrally-stratified flow over an extended homogeneous forest were used to calibrate a canopy model for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RaNS) method with the {\$}{\$}k-$\backslash$varepsilon {\$}{\$} turbulence model. It was found that, when modelling the forest as a porous medium, the canopy drag dissipates the turbulent kinetic energy (acts as a sink term). The proposed model was then tested in more complex flows: a finite length forest and a forested hill. In the finite length forest, the destruction of the turbulent kinetic energy by the canopy was overestimated near the edge, for a length approximately twice the tree height. In the forested hill, the model was less accurate inside the recirculation zone and overestimated the turbulent kinetic energy, due to an incorrect prediction of the production term. Nevertheless, the canopy model presented here provided consistent results in both a priori and a posteriori tests and improved the accuracy of RaNS simulations with the {\$}{\$}k-$\backslash$varepsilon {\$}{\$} model.

This chapter discusses the role and behavior of stomata in the hydrology of the soil–plant–atmosphere system. Stomata operate in the light in such a way as to maintain positive turgor in the leaves, in the majority of crop plants and other species. The transient response of stomata to changes in environment which cause rapid changes in plant–water relations is quite dramatic. The nature of the stomatal response to change in water potential must involve the mechanical and hydraulic attributes of the stomatal apparatus. There is only a tenuous relationship between the potential of water in leaf tissue in bulk and the local potential of water to which an individual stoma responds in ways, which are also discussed. Thus the transient response of stomata to change in rate of evaporation may be a device which is designed to enhance the speed of the response to light.},

abstract = {The relationship between intercepted photosynthetic active radiation, PAR and dry weight of single flower shoots of a rose (Rosa hybrida cv. Dallas) canopy managed with the arching technique was investigated through three growth cycles (summer, autumn and spring) under Mediterranean greenhouse conditions (Valencia, southern Spain). Non-destructive measurements were carried out at eight phenological growth stages and the evolution with thermal time of the in situ shoot dry weight, Ws, was estimated for each growth cycle. Intercepted PAR by the shoot, Rp,int, was estimated at a daily scale from a simplified single shoot interception model. The relationship between Ws and Rp,int was analysed using a radiation use efficiency (RUE)-based approach that considered three main periods throughout the shoot growth cycle: (i) from the stage the axillary bud had reached a length of about 1 cm (AB stage) till the visible bud (VB) stage, with a high apparent value of RUE due to the supply of assimilates from the plant reserves, (ii) from the VB stage to the stage of last leaf unfolded (LLF stage), when the shoot became self-supporting for assimilates, with the true value of RUE and (iii) from LLF stage till the stage of harvest (Y stage), when the shoots slowed down their growth and more assimilates were available for translocation to the basal part of the plant, with a low apparent value of RUE. This approach allowed the estimation of the imported and exported amounts of dry matter by the growing shoot. The reserves imported till the VB stage ranged from 5{\%} (spring and summer shoots) to 25{\%} (autumn shoots) of the shoot dry weight at harvest. The relative contribution of the shoot during the export phase was small ({\textless}5{\%}) for the autumn and summer shoots, but reached up to 30{\%} of its final dry weight for the spring shoots. A computational scheme was proposed to derive the dynamics of the import rate of assimilates from the plant reserves (roots, parent shoots, bent shoots and old foliage). It was found that the maximum translocation rate occurred near the 3LF stage (third unfolded leaf) and that the bud became self-supporting for assimilates at the VB stage. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Diurnal changes in net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g(s)) were measured in fully expanded young and old leaves in the uppermost canopy (35 m above ground). Maximum A was 12 and 10 micro mol m(-2) s(-1) in young and old leaves, respectively; however, because of large variation in A among leaves, mean maximum A in young and old leaves was only 6.6 and 5.5 micro mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Both g(s) and A declined in young leaves when T(leaf) exceeded 34 degrees C and leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (DeltaW) exceeded 0.025, whereas in old leaves, g(s) and A did not start to decline until T(leaf) and DeltaW exceeded 36 degrees C and 0.035, respectively. Under saturating light conditions, A was linearly related to g(s). The coefficient of variation (CV) for the difference between the CO(2) concentrations of ambient air and the leaf intercellular air space (C(a) - C(i)) was smaller than the CV for A or g(s), suggesting that maximum g(s) was mainly controlled by mesophyll assimilation (A/C(i)). Minimum C(i)/C(a) ratios were relatively high (0.72-0.73), indicating a small drought-induced stomatal limitation to A and non-conservative water use in the uppermost canopy leaves.},

abstract = {Planted shelterbelts are widely used to reduce wind speed in order to control aeolian sediment transport. Both the morphology of each plant and the distribution of multiple plants are the key parameters to determine the wind reduction efficiency of shelterbelts. By a comprehensive analysis of the data from wind tunnel measurement and computer simulation from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this paper studies airflow around a single plant with different shapes and resistance coefficients as well as around multiple plants with different row numbers, row spacing, column spacing and arrangement. The simulation is validated by wind tunnel experiment, and the realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence enclosure model used in the simulation provides good predictions of the airflow field for both single and multiple plants. The study shows the morphology and resistance coefficient of a single plant have a significant influence on the flow field. Plant canopy with large bottoms and small tops has a better shelter efficiency. Increasing the row number, decreasing the row spacing or column spacing will result in a better overall shelter effect of a shelterbelt. The efficiency of each plant for multiple-row shelterbelt is lower than that of a single row shelterbelt. A single row shelterbelt is the most efficient type in reducing wind speed, although two or three rows of stagger distribution shelterbelts are also have good efficiencies.},

This tension allows them to pull water out of the soil and up to their leaves. When this liquid rope breaks, owing to cavitation, they catch the ends to keep it from unraveling and then bind it back together. In parallel, they operate a second vascular system for the circulation of metabolites though their tissues, this time with positive pressures and flow that passes from leaf to root. In this article, we review the current state of understanding of water management in plants with an emphasis on the rich coupling of transport phenomena, thermodynamics, and active biological processes. We discuss efforts to replicate plant function in synthetic systems and point to opportunities for physical scientists and engineers to benefit from and contribute to the study of plants.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the convective heat and mass exchange of horticultural products and other plant organs (e.g., leaves) with the environment is of interest for several pre- and postharvest technologies and for plant microclimate analysis. Although these exchange processes often occur at the microscale (e.g. at lenticels, cracks, droplets or stomata, 10 
                        -4 to 10 
                        -2m), they are still often assessed on a macroscale level. In this study, the convective passive scalar (i.e., heat) transfer from a single spherical product is investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). For this purpose, the product is placed in a virtual wind-tunnel environment, thus not in its natural environment, e.g. on a tree. A sphere is used as reference system; an apple fruit is considered as model system. CFD validation is performed for a sphere, indicating a very good performance of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes shear stress transport k-?? turbulence model for the drag coefficient, Nusselt number, separation angle and recirculation length over a large Reynolds number range (10-3??10 
                        4). These quantities compare well for sphere and apple. The impact of discretely distributed microscopic scalar sources on the product surface on the convective transfer is analysed by explicitly modelling them. Such sources are representative for moisture loss through lenticels and cracks in the product's cuticle and evaporation of water or pesticide droplets at the surface. As scalar transfer is assumed only to occur locally at these sources, the active surface area is reduced. In this study, it is found that even at rather low surface coverage ratios, relatively large convective flow rates are found, indicating a non-linear dependency on the active surface area. This dependency is a function of coverage ratio, the Reynolds number and the source size. The proposed computational methodology for investigating the effects of these microscopic scalar sources shows a good performance, by which it is a viable alternative for experiments, which are very challenging at such small scales. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In recent years high-resolution numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions as an important part of global circulation models (GCM) or as a tool to assist in planning decisions has experienced increased consideration. In contrast large scale phenomena described in GCMs, the lower part of the atmosphere where we live is very sensitive to small scale processes which can develop an individual local climate, different to the expected average conditions. Especially in urban areas the great variety of different surfaces and sheltering obstacles produces a pattern of distinct microclimate systems. To simulate these local effects, microscale surface-plant-air interaction schemes with a special extension to typical artificial urban boundaries are needed. The paper focuses on the microscale numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions inside urban structures, especially the feedback between artificial surfaces like buildings and vegetation inside street canyons, backyards or greens. The three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model ENVI-met is presented and used to solve the basic equations forward in time and can simulate 'hard' wind field modifications (solid boundaries) like walls as well as 'soft' modifications (porous shelters) like vegetation. A case study of building a small park inside the CBD area will show what effects even small changes can have on local flow and temperature fields.},

abstract = {In response to drought, plants synthesise the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which triggers closure of the stomatal pores. This process is vital for plants to conserve water by reducing transpirational water loss. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of the Arabidopsis stomatal guard cell for combining genetic, molecular and biophysical approaches to characterise ABA action. However, genetic dissection of stomatal regulation has been limited by the difficulty of identifying a reliable phenotype for mutant screening. Leaf temperature can be used as an indicator to detect mutants with altered stomatal control, since transpiration causes leaf cooling. In this study, we optimised experimental conditions under which individual Arabidopsis plants with altered stomatal responses to drought can be identified by infrared thermography. These conditions were then used to perform a pilot screen for mutants that displayed a reduced ability to close their stomata and hence appeared colder than the wild type. Some of the mutants recovered were deficient in ABA accumulation, and corresponded to alleles of the ABA biosynthesis loci ABA1, ABA2 and ABA3. Interestingly, two of these novel aba2 alleles were able to intragenically complement the aba2-1 mutation. The remaining mutants showed reduced ABA responsiveness in guard cells. In addition to the previously known abi1-1 mutation, we isolated mutations at two novel loci designated as OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1) and OST2. Remarkably, ost1 and ost2 represent, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis mutations altering ABA responsiveness in stomata and not in seeds.},

abstract = {Models of vegetation function are widely used to predict the effects$\backslash$nof climate change on carbon, water and nutrient cycles of terrestrial$\backslash$necosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Stomatal conductance,$\backslash$nthe process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental$\backslash$nto such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories$\backslash$nof stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly$\backslash$nused in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental$\backslash$nobservations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions.$\backslash$nThe optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata$\backslash$nshould act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained.$\backslash$nWe reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal$\backslash$nstomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance$\backslash$nthat is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently,$\backslash$nwe obtain a unified stomatal model which has a similar form to existing$\backslash$nempirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation$\backslash$nfor model parameter values. The key model parameter, g(1), is predicted$\backslash$nto increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost$\backslash$nof carbon gain. The new model is fitted to a range of datasets ranging$\backslash$nfrom tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g(1) is shown to vary$\backslash$nwith growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional$\backslash$ntype. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal$\backslash$nconductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to$\backslash$ntest for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation$\backslash$nof the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance$\backslash$nis important for global change biology because it provides a simple$\backslash$ntheoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling$\backslash$nbetween carbon and water cycles under environmental change. },

Spatially distributed surface energy fluxes [net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), sensible heat (H), latent heat (LE)] and surface parameters [emissivity (e), albedo (a), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (Tsur)] were estimated and mapped at a pixel level from Landsat images and weather information using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) procedure as a function of grazing land management: heavily grazed (HGP) and moderately grazed pastures (MGP). Energy fluxes and land surface parameters were mapped and comparisons were made between the two sites. Over the study period, H, e and Tsur from HGP were higher by 6.7{\%}, 18.2{\%} and 2.9{\%} than in MGP, respectively. The study also showed that G, LE and NDVI were higher by 1.3{\%}, 1.6{\%} and 7.4{\%} forMGP than in HGP, respectively.

abstract = {Higher temperatures are measured in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas due to the urban heat island effect. One of the most efficient ways of removing heat from urban areas is wind-driven ventilation. Building configurations have a strong impact on the wind flow patterns and therefore on the heat removal from urban areas. Buoyancy can promote heat removal by inducing three-dimensional flow structures. This prevents the formation of standing vortices in street canyons, which are formed for forced convective flow regimes and trap heat inside the street canyons. A wind tunnel study is conducted for street canyons in an urban area. The wind tunnel floor is heated to different temperatures to induce buoyancy. The flow structures are measured with PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) on horizontal and vertical planes within the street canyon and the air temperatures are measured with an approach based on infrared thermography. The flows entering the street canyon through the lateral sides are measured on a horizontal PIV plane. These lateral flows can be found for buoyancy driven flows and are important, since they prevent the formation of standing vortices. To improve the heat removal in forced convective flows, different roof shapes and heights are studied and the lengths of the street canyon buildings are varied. The results show that lateral flows can be found for street canyons with non-uniform building heights and that the air temperatures are decreased in such street canyons due to the improved ventilation.},

abstract = {Arborists and managers of amenity trees could benefit from an improved understanding of how tree canopies withstand loading events such as wind, snow or ice. Knowledge of how material properties change along tree branches is important in understanding how a branch tips can bend in the wind yet resist displacement at the base which could lead to branch failure. Limited knowledge of modulus of elasticity (E or stiffness) in branch wood is available in the literature and is typically measured at only one location on a branch. This study investigated variation of E and density-specific E (E/. ) at five locations along the axis of 20 branches from seven trees. E and E/. were found to be 70{\%} lower at the branch tips than in the proximal locations. The variation in E was negatively correlated with the percentage of tissue area composed of vessels and positively correlated with mean fiber cell wall size, suggesting a balance between the two principle functions of hydraulics and mechanics. Reaction wood was observed in the form of gelatinous layers in fibers along the branch tops, but did not result in a difference in E between the top and bottoms at each branch location. It is proposed that differences in material properties are probably related to wood development type, as juvenile wood is considered to have lower stiffness than mature wood. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Water and solute flows in the coupled system of xylem and phloem were modeled together with predictions for xylem and whole stem diameter changes. With the model we could produce water circulation between xylem and phloem as presented by the M{\"{u}}nch hypothesis. Viscosity was modeled as an explicit function of solute concentration and this was found to vary the resistance of the phloem sap flow by many orders of magnitude in the possible physiological range of sap concentrations. Also, the sensitivity of the predicted phloem translocation to changes in the boundary conditions and parameters such as sugar loading, transpiration, and hydraulic conductivity were studied. The system was found to be quite sensitive to the sugar-loading rate, as too high sugar concentration, (approximately 7 MPa) would cause phloem translocation to be irreversibly hindered and soon totally blocked due to accumulation of sugar at the top of the phloem and the consequent rise in the viscosity of the phloem sap. Too low sugar loading rate, on the other hand, would not induce a sufficient axial water pressure gradient. The model also revealed the existence of M{\"{u}}nch "counter flow", i.e., xylem water flow in the absence of transpiration resulting from water circulation between the xylem and phloem. Modeled diameter changes of the stem were found to be compatible with actual stem diameter measurements from earlier studies. The diurnal diameter variation of the whole stem was approximately 0.1{\^{A}} mm of which the xylem constituted approximately one-third.},

abstract = {Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) employs two cameras to record simultaneous but distinct off-axis views of the same region of interest (illuminated plane within a flow seeded with tracer particles). Sufficient information is contained in the two views to extract the out-of-plane motion of particles, and also to eliminate perspective error which can contaminate the in-plane measurement. This review discusses the principle of stereoscopic PIV, the different stereoscopic configurations that have been used, the relative error in the out-of-plane to the in-plane measurement, and the relative merits of calibration-based methods for reconstructing the three-dimensional displacement vector in comparison to geometric reconstruction. It appears that the current trend amongst practitioners of stereoscopic PIV is to use digital cameras to record the two views in the angular displacement configuration while incorporating the Scheimpflug condition. The use of calibration methods has also gained prominence over geometric reconstruction.},

@article{Cleugh1998,
abstract = {The mechanisms by which a porous windbreak modifies airflow, microclimates and hence crop yields are addressed, based upon recent wind tunnel experiments, field observations and numerical modelling. This paper is thus an update to che excellent reviews in Brandle (1988). It shows how a turbulent mixing layer initiated at the top of the windbreak dominates the airflow behind a windbreak. This mixing layer spreads vertically as it moves downwind, growing at a rate determined by the turbulence in the approach flow and the windbreak's 'permeability'. The roughness of the terrain and land-cover upwind, windbreak height and porosity are thus the main controls on the amount and extent of shelter provided by a windbreak. The changes in temperature, humidity, heat and evaporation fluxes given these changes in turbulence are then described. Based on the turbulent mixing layer model, the highly sheltered 'quiet zone' will be typically warmer and more humid while further downwind in the 'wake zone', cooler and drier conditions would be expected. The careful experimental studies needed to verify these theoretical predictions have not yet been published. Shade is also shown to modify the heating in the quiet zone and, depending on the orientation of the windbreak, can offset the warming in the quiet zone. Lastly, the mechanisms affecting plant productivity are described in light of these airflow and microclimate changes. A major effect of a windbreak is to reduce the incidence of low frequency, high magnitude damage events such as sandblasting or lodging. Microclimate effects, however, do not always improve productivity. For example, while shelter may improve water-use efficiency in irrigated crops by increasing yields and reducing water-use, this may not be the case in dryland agriculture.},

This is particularly relevant in the fluid dynamics community, especially when PIV measurements are employed for CFD data validation. In spite of the relevance of the subject, the first uncertainty quantification methods have been developed only in the last two years. The present work describes a comparative assessment of four approaches proposed in literature: the uncertainty surface method (Timmins et al, 2012), the particle disparity approach (Sciacchitano et al, 2013; called image-matching approach in this reference), the peak ratio approach (Charonko and Vlachos, 2013) and the correlation statistics method (Wieneke and Prevost, 2014). The analysis makes use of a data base produced during a dedicated experiment where the instantaneous velocity field is known with high accuracy by means of an independent and more accurate measurement system. Strengths and limitations of the four uncertainty quantification approaches observed within the different flow regimes and imaging conditions are discussed.},

abstract = {In Singapore, rapid population influx has led to demands for converting natural areas to pubic housing. The heat island in Singapore city has been documented. However, less attention has been placed on the cooling effect of city's green areas. To address this issue, temperature and humidity measurements were conducted in two big city green areas. One is the city's natural reserve - Bukit Batok Nature Park (BBNP) (36 ha) and the other is a neighbourhood park - Clementi Woods Park (CWP) (12 ha). The measurements were conducted at both vegetated areas and their surroundings. The results indicated the cooling effects of city greens are remarkable not only at vegetated areas but also the surrounding built environments. To further explore the role of the green area on moderating the microclimate, two simulation programmes, TAS and Envi-met, were employed, respectively, for the two parks. The aims are to explore the patterns of energy consumptions of a typical commercial building near to Bukit Batok Nature Park and different thermal conditions with and without Clementi Woods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ferreira2009,
abstract = {The analysis, modeling and design of the lift-driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) has challenged the wind energy community for many decades; this limited progress in knowledge has severely impaired the development of the VAWT, giving rise to the myth that the VAWT rotor is inherently inefficient (in comparison with the more conventional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine - HAWT) or too complex for commercial implementation. In this research work, we take a new path on the analysis of the VAWT: instead of considering a rotor that creates a perturbation on the flow (wake and induction field), we consider an unsteady wake, to which a rotor energy-conversion system is associated, obtaining the loading on the blade by better understanding the flow. The research aims at understanding the wake and its relation with energy conversion and the loading on the rotor system. Four main questions drive this research: • What is the relation between blade loading and energy conversion? • How does the near wake of the VAWT develop? • What is the difference between the 2D and the 3D wake? • How does understanding the near wake improve our design? At the end of this dissertation we achieve a clear and insightful view on the 2D and 3D aerodynamics from the point of view of the wake, that significantly improves the aerodynamic design and optimization of new VAWT rotors for energy conversion and propulsion, opening a new design space and methodology. The results and discussion presented in this dissertation are organized in five steps (see thesis outline, Chapter 1): • Part I: understand the fundamental VAWT aerodynamics and how these relate with the research presented in this dissertation. • Part II: understand the energy exchange process in the 2D plane by understanding the shedding of the wake over the rotation, and the wake expansion in 2D. Analyze the impact of dynamic stall on the near wake evolution, and how to extract blade load information from the near wake in dynamic stall. • Part III: understand the impact of the spanwise dimension of the rotor and the role of the consequent trailing vorticity. Investigate the little known skewed flow. • Part IV: understand better the energy exchange process, the wake's generation and the decoupling between loading and energy conversion. Propose new approaches and guidelines for the aerodynamic rotor design. • Part V: discuss the main results and conclusions of the research, and its impact on new aerodynamic research and design approaches, both for 2D and 3D VAWT rotors. In Part I (Chapter 2) we frame our research approach, analyzing the VAWT from a wake perspective, by considering both 2D and 3D aerodynamics of the VAWT at two different scales: aerofoil/blade scale and rotor scale. We divide the rotor in windward (315◦ {\textless} $\theta$ {\textless} 45◦), upwind (45◦{\textless} $\theta$ {\textless} 135◦), leeward (135◦ {\textless} $\theta$ {\textless} 225◦) and downwind (225◦ {\textless} $\theta$ {\textless} 315◦) regions of the rotation. This approach obsolesces the conventional division of the rotor into upwind and downwind halves; while the upwind/downwind division is driven by angle of attack considerations (blade loading problem), this new segmentation is determined by the shedding of vorticity (energy conversion problem), a more useful and effective approach. The wake is also split into shed vorticity due to the time gradient of the bound circulation, and trailing vorticity due to the spatial gradient of the bound circulation; this division leads to our 2D and 3D analysis of the flow. In Part II, we analyze the 2D rotor and wake at two scales: rotor and blade. The two flow scales are obviously related, in the sense that the rotor's aerodynamics are the result of the wakes generated at the several blades and the blade experiences an induction field due to the vorticity distributed over the wake at the rotor scale. The separation in blade and rotor scale is in fact a separation of two views on the total system: • The rotor, as an energy exchange system, where the energy exchange results in a wake and streamline expansion. • The blade, as an aerodynamic loading system, where the design-objective loading is associated with an equivalent bound circulation. The time variation of this bound circulation results in a shed wake. The 2D potential-flow analysis (Chapter 3) shows that: • the conventional breakdown of the VAWT into upwind and downwind actuator systems is incorrect, leading to an overestimation of energy conversion on the upwind half of the rotation and an underestimation in the downwind half. • contrary to the HAWT, the induction is not a function of the total loading, but only of the load component associated with the azimuthally varying circulation. • it is possible to significantly improve Double Multiple Streamtube models by incorporating a better description of the flow. The proposed improved model clearly surpasses conventional models on the prediction of the induction and loading. • the impact of the blade bound-circulation constant-term is small in comparison to the time-varying bound-circulation term; therefore, the induction field of the 2D VAWT in potential flow can be defined by only the number of blades, rotor solidity and tip-speed ratio. This allows for the obsolescence of streamtube momentum models, replaced by faster and more accurate potential flow vortex models. In Chapters 4 and 5 we visualize and quantify, experimentally and numerically, the flow field in the near wake of the blade during the upwind and leeward segments of the motion, at tip-speed ratios $\lambda$ = 2, 3 and 4, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). An interesting physical aspect of the vortical flow in dynamic stall, especially at low tip-speed ratios, is the transport of the shed vorticity with the blade. This transport of the vortical structures with the blade means that the geometry of the wake, due to viscous effects, differs from what is obtained with potential flow. A different spatial distribution of the shed vorticity implies a different induction field, which might imply a reduction of the effectiveness of momentum models and simple potential-flow models and change the rotor's performance. The results show two important effects: • At the rotor scale, the transport of vorticity with the blade, rolled in the leading edge/trailing edge separated vortices. • At the blade scale, the importance of the small scale vortices for the oscillations on pressure distribution and loads. In Chapter 6 we use the experimental and numerical data from the previous chapters to evaluate the feasibility of extracting information from the flow/wake measured with PIV, even in dynamic stall, for improving flow analysis and model validation. In Part III we introduce the fourth dimension of our problem: the spanwise direction. The finite span leads to a non-constant spanwise distribution of circulation on the blade, and this distribution leads to the release of trailing vorticity, of which the blade tip vortex is the most prominent component. In Chapter 7 we measure the wake at the tip-vortex region of the VAWT; in Chapter 8 we combine these experimental results with 3D unsteady free-wake potential-flow simulations to: • experimentally and numerically observe, quantify and analyze the generation and convection of the 3D tip vortex of the VAWT. • experimentally, numerically and analytically investigate the effect of blade-tip shape on the generation and convection of the tip vortex, with focus on the added circulation due to the motion of the blade. • combine experimental measurements and numerical simulations to analyze: the 3D wake of the VAWT; the interaction between shed and trailing vorticity; the roll-up and expansion of the wake in the leeward and windward regions; the in-rotor convection and inboard/outboard motion of the tip vortex; the 3D induction field; the 3D blade wake interaction during the downwind blade passage; and the effect of trailing vorticity in the spanwise distribution of circulation, including the 2D to 3D load direction reversal in the downwind blade passage. The spanwise dimension of the flow also gives rise to a new form of misalignment between the flow and the axis: skewed flow. In Chapter 9 we analyze the physics of skewed flow, flow asymmetry, near wake development, blade-wake interaction and impact on energy conversion. The analysis of the VAWT from the point of view of the 2D and 3D near wake is shown to be very effective in understanding: the physics of the flow; the energy exchange process; how the total energy exchange over one rotation actually relates to the local aerodynamic loading on the blade; the impact of implementing an essentially 2D energy conversion process into a 3D aerodynamic system; and the resulting inefficiencies due to the finite span and trailing vorticity. In Part IV (Chapter 10) we show that it is possible to decompose the VAWT design problem into designing for loading and designing for energy conversion, opening a large design space and proposing a new methodology, impacting both 2D and 3D flow. We also show that, although the 2D wake does not vary significantly with variation in the pitching axis location and blade camber, the 3D wake and performance are significantly affected by these variations. This is due to the impact that varying the bound circulation has on the release of trailing vorticity; a larger trailing vorticity generated during the upwind blade passage implies a larger induction due to trailing vorticity, and a worse interaction at the downwind blade passage. The effects of variation of camber and/or pitching axis in 2D and 3D performance are contradictory and complementary and can be simultaneously optimized. In Part V (Chapter 11) we further develop these and other main conclusions, discussing their impact on VAWT aerodynamics. The research here presented implies a break from conventional approaches to the VAWT aerodynamics, allowing for the development of new research and models, both in 2D flow (aerofoil design, rotor energy conversion optim},

abstract = {This paper introduces a coupled model to predict the micro-climatic conditions in an urban street canyon. The model couples three sub-models: (i) a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, which solves the convective heat, air and vapor transport, (ii) a Building Envelope Heat and Moisture (BE-HAM) model which solves heat and moisture transfer and storage within porous materials, and (iii) a radiation model (RAD) which accounts for the radiative heat exchange between the urban surfaces and the sky. The applicability of the model is demonstrated by two case studies. In both, the effect of evaporative cooling on the surface and air temperatures in a street canyon as well as on the thermal comfort is evaluated. The case studies differ in the free-stream wind conditions. We found that the reduced surface and air temperatures during evaporative cooling have a positive influence on the comfort sensation. Nevertheless, this effect is partly canceled out by the increase in vapor pressure. Comparing both cases, we observed less comfortable conditions for the case with lower free-stream wind speed due to the more pronounced buoyancy effects and the reduced mixing of the air in the street canyon. The case studies illustrate the complex interplay among temperatures, vapor pressures, and wind speeds, as well as the spatial and temporal variation of these quantities, which stresses the need for detailed modeling approaches, accounting for the full complexity of the urban micro-climate. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Knowledge on convective water vapour exchange at leaf-air interfaces is required to assess transpiration of leaves via stomata and evaporation of droplets, which can both be considered as microscopic moisture sources, heterogeneously distributed across the leaf. An innovative modelling approach was proposed to investigate such convective mass transport from leaf surfaces, using computational fluid dynamics (shear-stress transport k-?? turbulence model with low-Reynolds number modelling). The main novelty lies in the fact that a large range of spatial scales (10-5-10-1 m) was included and that the individual microscopic sources were modelled discretely. The convective exchange from the leaf model was strongly dependent on three parameters: surface coverage, air speed and source size. The relation between the convective flow rate and both the coverage ratio (CR) and the microscopic Sherwood number, i.e., the ratio of the source size to the viscous sublayer thickness, was quantified. It was shown that well-established convective transfer coefficients, obtained from plates or leaf models for a CR of 100{\%}, can result in a significant overprediction of the convective exchange, compared to more realistic, lower CR. Furthermore, small variations in stomatal density (CR), e.g., due to biological variability, were shown to have a large impact on the convective exchange and droplets were found to evaporate more rapidly at low CR. The decrease in mass transfer rate due to stomatal closure was quantified as well. The proposed numerical modelling approach can be applied to increase our understanding of leaf transpiration and droplet evaporation, but also of the leaf boundary-layer microclimate and the transport processes therein. A critical discussion of the modelling assumptions allowed to identify focus points for future model refinement as well as future research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using synchronous multi-level high frequency velocity measurements, the turbulence spectra within the trunk space of an alpine hardwood forest were analysed. The spectral short-circuiting of the energy cascade for each velocity component was well reproduced by a simplified spectral model that retained return-to-isotropy and component-wise work done by turbulence against the drag and wake production. However, the use of an anisotropic drag coefficient was necessary to reproduce these measured component-wise spectra. The degree of anisotropy in the vertical drag was shown to vary with the element Reynolds number. The wake production frequency in the measured spectra was shown to be consistent with the vortex shedding frequency at constant Strouhal number given by f (vs) = 0.21 (U) over bar /d, where d can be related to the stem diameter at breast height (dbh) and (U) over bar is the local mean velocity. The energetic scales, determined from the inflection point instability at the canopy-atmosphere interface, appear to persist into the trunk space when C(du)a(cr)h(c)/beta {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, where C (du) is the longitudinal drag coefficient, a (cr) is the crown-layer leaf area density, h (c) is the canopy height, and beta is the dimensionless momentum absorption at the canopy top.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to the calibration of thermal infrared measurements of leaf temperature for the estimation of stomatal conductance and illustrates its application to thermal imaging of plant leaves. The approach is based on a simple reformulation of the leaf energy balance equation that makes use of temperature measurements on reference surfaces of known conductance to water vapour. The use of reference surfaces is an alternative to the accurate measurement of all components of the leaf energy balance and is of potentially wide application in studies of stomatal behaviour. The resolution of the technique when applied to thermal images is evaluated and some results of using the approach in the laboratory for the study of stomatal behaviour in leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. are presented. Conductances calculated from infrared measurements were well correlated with estimates obtained using a diffusion porometer.},

abstract = {Flow characteristics of turbulent wake behind porous fences have been investigated experimentally. The velocity fields were measured using the two-frame PTV method in a circulating water channel. The fence models used in this study have geometric porosity (??) of 0{\%}, 20{\%}, 40{\%} and 65{\%}, respectively. Each fence model was located in uniform flow whose boundary layer thickness (??) at the fence location was about 0.1 of the fence height (H). Among the porous fences used in this study, the porous fence with porosity ?? = 20{\%} shows the maximum reduction of mean streamwise velocity, but it has the highest vertical mean velocity at about x/H = 1 location and large turbulence intensity in the near wake region. However, the porous fence with ?? = 40{\%} has good flow characteristics for abating wind erosion with small turbulent fluctuations and a relatively large reduction in mean velocity. Except for the solid fence (?? = 0{\%}), two shear layers develop from the porous fences. As the fence porosity (??) increases, the height of the shear layer and the streamline curvature decrease. When the porosity (??) is greater than 40{\%}, there is no re-circulation flow behind the fence due to the strong bleed flow, the Reynolds shear stress is nearly negligible in the entire near-wake region and relatively small turbulent kinetic energies are concentrated in the region just behind the fence (x/H {\textless}0.5). When the fence porosity is less than 20{\%}, the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy are strong over the fence and in the shear layer near the reattachment region.},

For highly concentrated particle suspensions, material turbidity has long been a substantial impediment to these techniques, which explains why they have been scarcely used so far. A renewed interest has emerged with the development of specific methods combining the use of iso-index suspensions and imaging techniques. This review paper gives a broad overview of recent advances in visualization techniques suited to concentrated particle suspensions. In particular, we show how classic methods such as PIV, LDV, particle tracking velocimetry, and laser induced fluorescence can be adapted to deal with concentrated particle suspensions.},

abstract = {A direct 3D CFD modelling of airflow within model plant canopies was performed with separate models for the leaves and the branches of the canopy. The effect of the branches on airflow was modelled by introducing the 3D architecture of the canopies into the model and that of the leaves was modelled by adding drag force terms in the momentum and turbulent energy equations in porous sub-domains created around the branches. Wind tunnel experiments were used to validate the model. The experiments were carried out for inlet velocities of 10 m s-1 and 15 m s-1 with two artificial 1:10 scaled model trees, fully leafed, half leafed and leafless. Simulations were made with a full closure model (FCM) and with the presented integrated model (IM). FCM and IM gave a maximum percent error of 34 and 30, respectively for average air velocity, U. On horizontal average basis both methods gave fairly comparable accuracies with maximum errors of 16.6{\%} for FCM and 13.7{\%} for IM but on local basis both horizontally and vertically within the tree height the present approach gave a better accuracy. The present model also gave qualitatively good results for turbulent kinetic energy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {High-density urban areas are often associated with limited outdoor natural ventilation. Given the growing call for more vegetation in cities, it is important to study the wind resistant of urban trees in order to address outdoor natural ventilation problem in the landscape planning. Currently, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and wind tunnel experiment can only model the simplified street canyon with roadside trees, at the expense of intensive technical support and high computational cost. Thus, they are mostly for the research purpose only, and the impact of research outputs on the landscape planning remains low. In this study, we developed a practical semi-empirical model to provide scientific understandings for the landscape planning practice. The new model was developed based on the balance between momentum flux and the drag force of both buildings and trees on air flow. Friction velocity (u*) was modeled and validated by existing CFD and wind tunnel data, and effective frontal area density ($\lambda$f{\_}tree) was estimated by the measured leaf area index. Effects of urban context density and trees (i.e. plant canopy density and typology) on wind environment were clarified. This research correlated the urban density and tree geometry indices with wind speed, thereby enabling planners to calculate trees' effects on airflow using their in-house data. With such new practical tool and understandings, the knowledge-based landscape planning can be conducted to introduce more trees into urban areas, while avoiding negative effects of trees on the outdoor wind environment at cities at the same time.},

abstract = {The spatial peak surface shear stress on the ground beneath vegetation canopies is responsible for the onset of particle entrainment and its precise and accurate prediction is essential when modelling soil, snow or sand erosion. This study investigates shear-stress partitioning, i.e. the fraction of the total fluid stress on the entire canopy that acts directly on the surface, for live vegetation canopies (plant species: Lolium perenne) using measurements in a controlled wind-tunnel environment. Rigid, non-porous wooden blocks instead of the plants were additionally tested for the purpose of comparison since previous wind-tunnel studies used exclusively artificial plant imitations for their experiments on shear-stress partitioning. The drag partitioning model presented by Raupach (Boundary-Layer Meteorol 60:375-395, 1992) and Raupach et al. (J Geophys Res 98:3023-3029, 1993), which allows the prediction of the total shear stress tau on the entire canopy as well as the peak and the average shear-stress ratios, is tested against measurements to determine the model parameters and the model's ability to account for shape differences of various roughness elements. It was found that the constant c, needed to determine the total stress tau and which was unspecified to date, can be assumed a value of about c = 0.27. Values for the model parameter m, which accounts for the difference between the spatial surface average and the peak shear stress, are difficult to determine because m is a function of the roughness density, the wind velocity and the roughness element shape. A new definition for a parameter a is suggested as a substitute for m. This a parameter is found to be more closely universal and solely a function of the roughness element shape. It is able to predict the peak surface shear stress accurately. Finally, a method is presented to determine the new a parameter for different kinds of roughness elements.},

abstract = {Arborists and managers of amenity trees could benefit from an improved understanding of how tree canopies withstand loading events such as wind, snow or ice. Knowledge of how material properties change along tree branches is important in understanding how a branch tips can bend in the wind yet resist displacement at the base which could lead to branch failure. Limited knowledge of modulus of elasticity (E or stiffness) in branch wood is available in the literature and is typically measured at only one location on a branch. This study investigated variation of E and density-specific E (E/. ) at five locations along the axis of 20 branches from seven trees. E and E/. were found to be 70{\%} lower at the branch tips than in the proximal locations. The variation in E was negatively correlated with the percentage of tissue area composed of vessels and positively correlated with mean fiber cell wall size, suggesting a balance between the two principle functions of hydraulics and mechanics. Reaction wood was observed in the form of gelatinous layers in fibers along the branch tops, but did not result in a difference in E between the top and bottoms at each branch location. It is proposed that differences in material properties are probably related to wood development type, as juvenile wood is considered to have lower stiffness than mature wood. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Urban land-cover change threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon storage. However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km(2), nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr(-1)), equal to ∼5{\%} of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.},

abstract = {Knowledge of indoor ventilation airflow is essential for creating a healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient indoor climate in buildings, airplanes, cars, ships, etc. In the past decades, numerical methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have become primary tools to assess indoor airflow. However, validation of numerical simulations by high-quality experimental data is imperative. Although a lot of studies have focused on experimental data for turbulent ventilation flow, there is a lack of experimental data for transitional ventilation flow. Transitional ventilation flow is in general associated with relatively low air velocities inside the enclosure. This paper presents detailed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements and an analysis of transitional flow in a ventilated enclosure. The isothermal forced mixing ventilation flow is driven by a transitional plane jet. The measurements are performed in a reduced-scale water-filled model for slot Reynolds numbers ranging from 800 to 2500. Flow visualizations indicate that this range of Reynolds numbers results in transitional flow, including the development of large coherent structures in the outer region of the jet. The measurements are analyzed in terms of mean velocity near the inlet and in the entire flow domain, and in terms of turbulence intensity and vorticity. Specific attention is given to the Coanda effect by which the free plane jet develops into a wall jet. The experimental data and analysis are specifically intended to support the development and validation of numerical models for ventilation flow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The cooling effect of small urban green wooded sites of various geometric configurations in summer is the object of this study. It was studied experimentally at 11 different wooded sites in the Tel-Aviv urban complex during the period July–August 1996. An empirical model is developed in this study for predicting the cooling effect inside the wooded sites. The model is based on the statistical analysis carried out on 714 experimental observations gathered each hour from the 11 sites on calm days, when urban climate is expressed. Two factors were found to explain over 70{\%} of the air temperature variance inside the studied green site, namely, the partial shaded area under the tree canopy and the air temperature of the non-wooded surroundings adjoining the site. The specific cooling effect of the site due to its geometry and tree characteristics, besides the shading, was found to be relatively small, about 0.5 K, out of an average cooling of about 3 K at noon. The cooling effect of the green wooded areas on their immediate surroundings at noon was also analyzed. The findings corroborate earlier studies that the range is noticeable. At small green sites, the cooling effect estimated in this study is perceivable up to about 100 m in the streets branching out from the site. The empirical findings in this study permit development of tools for incorporating the climatic effects of green areas in the urban design. Some policy measures are proposed accordingly, for alleviating the “heat island” effect in the urban environment.},

abstract = {Currently, Eulerian flow solvers are very efficient in accurately resolving flow structures near solid boundaries. On the other hand, they tend to be diffusive and to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after a short distance away from solid boundaries. The use of high order methods and fine grids, although alleviating this problem, gives rise to large systems of equations that are expensive to solve. Lagrangian solvers, as the regularized vortex particle method, have shown to eliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a drawback, the modelling of solid boundaries is less accurate, more complex and costly than with Eulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements). Given the drawbacks and advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers the combination of both methods, giving rise to a hybrid solver, is advantageous. The main idea behind the hybrid solver presented is the following. In a region close to solid boundaries the flow is solved with an Eulerian solver, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved (possibly with an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the computational power and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that region the flow is solved with a vortex particle method. In this work we present this hybrid scheme and verify it numerically on known 2D benchmark cases: dipole flow, flow around a cylinder and flow around a stalled airfoil. The success in modelling these flow conditions presents this hybrid approach as a promising alternative, bridging the gap between highly resolved and computationally intensive Eulerian CFD simulations and fast but less resolved Lagrangian simulations.},

abstract = {This study proposes a new water-based transparent material called Aquabeads for modeling flow in natural soils. Three types of this material were used to model miscible and multiphase flow transport process in layered soil systems. An optical system was set up to trace flow movements in a two-dimensional (2D) physical model of a soil profile, analyzed using digital image processing to define images of 2D concentration profiles in the model. Model surfactant flushing tests were conducted using a layered soil system and two contaminants, mineral oil and motor oil, in order to illustrate the feasibility of using this water-based polymer to visualize geoenvironmental contamination problems. A surfactant solution made of Triton X-100 mixed with sec-butanol alcohol and xanthan gum was used to achieve a recovery ratio of 88.5 {\%} of motor oil and 95.8 {\%} of mineral oil. Because a transparent soil is used, the optical systems allows for visualizing surfactant flushing. Addition of xanthan gum to increase viscosity prevents mineral oil's downward migration, thus significantly enhancing the oil recovery. The increase in viscosity of the surfactant prevents motor oil from bypassing the plume, thus enhancing recovery by up to 20 times. The study demonstrates that Aquabeads are suitable for modeling multiphase flow, particularly in educational settings.},

abstract = {Forest canopies play a major role in biosphere-atmosphere interaction. Their actual temperature may deviate substantially from ambient atmospheric conditions as reported by weather stations. While there is a long tradition of false-colour imagery, new digital technologies in combination with IR transmission lenses and autocalibration routines permit unprecedented insight into the actual temperature regimes in canopies. We report canopy leaf temperature distribution over space and time assessed over a 35 m tall mixed deciduous forest in NW Switzerland by means of a construction crane and a high resolution thermal camera. At an air temperature of 25°C, conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylverstris and Larix decidua) and deciduous broad-leaved trees with exceptionally high transpiration (Quercus petraea) or very open, low density canopies (Prunus avium) exhibited mean canopy leaf temperatures close to air temperature (0.3-2.7 K above ambient) and the maximum amplitude within a given crown reached 6-9 K. In contrast, broad-leaved deciduous species with dense canopies (Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) were 4.5-5 K warmer than air temperature and showed within canopy temperature amplitudes of 10-12 K. Calculated leaf boundary resistance was clearly lower for conifers (3-24 m s-1) than for broad-leaved trees (33-64 m s-1). The study illustrates that mean leaf temperatures in forest trees are not adequately explained by either stomatal conductance or leaf dimensions, but strongly depend on canopy architecture (leaf area density, branching habits) in combination with leaf traits. Aerodynamic leaf and canopy characteristics lead to strongly enhanced vapour pressure gradients (evaporative forcing) and leaf temperatures vary enormously over short distances, calling for statistical temperature models (frequency distribution) rather than the use of means in any flux calculations. The presence/absence of certain tree taxa plays a key role in forest surface temperature. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This review focuses on timber quality with a particular emphasis on Sitka spruce and sawlog production, although issues pertaining to pulp and panel quality are also dealt with. The review is split into three broad areas. The first covers the factors controlling wood quality that operate within the timber itself and also at the whole-tree scale. These include knots, grain angle, wood density, tracheid length, microfibril angle, juvenile wood and compression wood, tree/log size, growth rate, stem straightness and stem taper. The second section reviews the link between silviculture, site and genetics on these controlling factors and the consequences for wood quality for different end-uses. The silvicultural factors reviewed are rotation length, initial spacing, respacing before canopy closure, thinning after canopy closure, nursing mixtures, pruning, cultivation, weed suppression and fertilizer use. Site factors include site quality, wind, slope, and snow and ice. There is a brief section on the role of genetic improvement on timber quality. Finally, the review provides conclusions and recommends that stands should be identified as being suitable for sawlogs or fibre products and then managed consistently throughout the rotation with a strong focus on the final wood product. For Sitka spruce, the objective of maximizing volume yield appears to be compromising batten performance and buyers should consider premiums for stands where quality has been provided rather than quantity. Long-term forest plans and certification could play an increasing role in providing the assurance that good consistent silvicultural practice had been undertaken throughout the rotation, hence creating the possibility of offering clear premiums for high grade timber.},

abstract = {Flexible terrestrial and aquatic plants bend in response to fluid motion and this reconfiguration mechanism reduces drag forces, which protects against uprooting or breaking under high winds and currents. The impact of reconfiguration on the flow can be described quantitatively by introducing a drag coefficient that decreases as a power-law function of velocity with a negative exponent known as the Vogel number. In this paper, two case studies are conducted to examine the connection between reconfiguration and turbulence dynamics within a canopy. First, a flume experiment was conducted with a model seagrass meadow. As the flow rate increased, both the mean and unsteady one-dimensional linear elastic reconfiguration increased. In the transition between the asymptotic regimes of negligible and strong reconfiguration, there is a regime of weak reconfiguration, in which the Vogel number achieved its peak negative value. Second, large-eddy simulation was conducted for a maize canopy, with different modes of reconfiguration characterized by increasingly negative values of the Vogel number. Even though the mean vertical momentum flux was constrained by field measurements, changing the mode of reconfiguration altered the distribution, strength, and fraction of momentum carried by strong and weak events. Despite the differences between these two studies, similar effects of the Vogel number on turbulence dynamics were demonstrated. In particular, a more negative Vogel number leads to a more positive peak of the skewness of streamwise velocity within the canopy, which indicates a preferential penetration of strong events into a vegetation canopy. We consider different reconfiguration geometry (one- and two-dimensional) and regime (negligible, weak, and strong) that can apply to a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic canopies.},

abstract = {We analyze the combined effects of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties and the water uptake by plant roots on unsaturated water flow. For this analysis, we use a simplified macroscopic root water uptake model which is usually applied only for homogeneous or layered soil and therefore we also determine whether it is applicable for multidimensional heterogeneous media. Analytical solutions for mean and variance of pressure head (first-order second-moment approximations) in layered media and numerical solutions of two-dimensional (2-D) autocorrelated multi-Gaussian and non multi-Gaussian parameter fields are analyzed for steady state and transient flow conditions. For non-Gaussian topological features, that have little influence on the mean and the variance of the pressure field if root water uptake is ignored, we test whether the influence is significant if root water uptake is accounted for. The results reveal that, in field structures with large patches of coarse material, local regions with pressure head values at the wilting point develop; these are surrounded by wet material. Without a compensation mechanism for local stress, the global transpiration demand is not met if local wilting occurs. Various compensation mechanisms are tested that depend, respectively, on the saturation, the relative conductivity or a strategy where the deficit in the global uptake rate is equally distributed to unstressed locations. The strategies lead to a global actual transpiration rate at the potential value and attenuate the formation of locally wilted areas. Wilted regions can, however, still occur, and may be an artifact of the simplified model concept as root-soil interactions are neglected. Therefore simplified macroscopic models for root water uptake should be used with caution in heterogeneous media.},

abstract = {Accurate predictions of convective heat and mass transfer at air-porous material interfaces are essential in many engineering applications, one example being optimisation of industrial drying processes with respect to energy consumption and product quality. For porous-material modelling purposes, simplified convective transfer coefficients (CTCs) are often used to avoid explicit air-flow modelling. Alternatively, conjugate models have been introduced recently and are being more widely used. Conjugate modelling has the advantage that it does not require the use of CTCs or of the heat and mass transfer analogy. Instead, these CTCs can be identified a-posteriori. In this study, an overview of the existing methods to predict convective heat and mass transfer at air-porous material interfaces is given, with a specific focus on conjugate modelling. The improved accuracy of this approach is indicated based on two case studies, namely hygroscopic loading and convective drying. A large spatial and temporal variability of the CTCs is found by means of conjugate modelling. This approach provides increased accuracy, which is especially relevant for complex flow problems, such as in industrial drier systems. However, the sensitivity to the convective boundary conditions can be limited in some cases, e.g. for hygroscopic loading. Instead of improving accuracy significantly here, conjugate modelling will rather impose an additional modelling effort, which often requires conjugate model code development as these models are not readily available. Before embarking on a conjugate modelling study, it is advised to perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the convective boundary conditions: in some cases, sufficient accuracy can be obtained using empirical CTCs from literature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Upright porous wind fences have been studied extensively because of their wide use. This paper analyzes the drag force and moment of fences to provide corroborating evidence for design of the optimal porosity that has been suggested in previous studies. The analysis of drag force and moment was based on the velocity measurements from scaled simulation tests in a wind tunnel. Particle image velocimetry was employed to provide detailed measurements of the instantaneous velocity fields around fences with different levels of porosity at different free-stream wind velocities. The data enabled us to calculate drag force and moment of fences using the integral form of momentum equation and the integral form of angular momentum equation. The drag force and moment were converted to dimensionless drag coefficient and moment coefficient. Drag force, moment, drag coefficient and moment coefficient revealed a critical fence porosity of around 0.3, which was consistent with the optimal porosity suggested in previous studies. At this critical porosity, the vertical drag force was zero, and the means of drag coefficients and moment coefficients for different wind velocities attained their maximum. The vertical drag force changed direction when the fence porosity became greater or less than the critical porosity. When the porosity was increased beyond the critical value the drag coefficient and moment coefficient decreased rapidly. Empirical equations were developed to relate drag force and moment to wind velocity, fence porosity and height.},

abstract = {This study reports simultaneous measurements of wind at single point positions up- and downstream of a tree and a numerical experiment with the aim of quantifying the interaction of a solitary tree and the wind field. Relative to the inflow velocity, the velocity deficit in the wake of the tree showed strong seasonal dependence, with wake velocities changing between 70{\%} and 10{\%} of the upstream value from no-leaf winter conditions to full-leaf summer conditions. Whereas for the winter tree the turbulence intensity in the wake is everywhere reduced relative to the upwind flow, for the summer tree the turbulent intensity is markedly reduced in the inner wake, but increased in the outer wake. For the numerical experiment, the combination of (i) a high-detail tree model, based on terrestrial lidar scanning, and (ii) observations of the total bending moment on the tree, taken from strain gauges mounted on the stem, provided the tree parameterization. By this approach, the drag coefficient is not calibrated to fit the observed wind speed in the wake, but the total observed bending moment. Mean wind speed observations in the wake of both the winter and summer tree were well reproduced by the model with mean absolute errors lower than or equal to 5{\%} throughout the wake transect. Also the turbulence intensity in the wake were well reproduced for the summer tree, whereas it was overestimated for the winter tree. Effects of changing tree model and grid resolution are demonstrated and discussed. Based on the presented findings, we recommend to estimate the total bending moment (or drag force) on modelled trees to ensure transferability of results between different numerical setups.},

abstract = {This paper reviews current parameterizations developed and implemented within Computational Fluid Dynamics models for the study of the effects linking vegetation, mainly trees, to urban air quality and thermal conditions. In the literature, passive mitigation via deposition is parametrized as a volumetric sink term in the transport equation of pollutants, while a volumetric source term is used for particle resuspension. The aerodynamics effects are modelled via source and sink terms of momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate. A volumetric cooling power is finally considered to account for the thermal (transpirational cooling) effects of vegetation. The most recent applications are also summarized with a focus on the relative importance of both aerodynamic and deposition effects, together with recent studies evaluating thermal effects. Those studies have shown that the aerodynamic effects of trees are stronger than the positive effects of deposition, however locally the pollutant concentration increases or decreases depending on the complex inter-relation between local factors such as vegetation type and density, meteorological conditions, street geometry, pollutant characteristics and emission rates. Unlike aerodynamic and deposition effects on pollutant dispersion which were also found in street far from trees, the thermal effects were in general locally restricted to the close vicinity of the vegetation and to the street canyon itself. Future requirements in CFD modelling include more in depth investigation of resuspension and thermal effects, as well as of the VOCs emissions and chemical reactions. The overall objective of this review is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive summary on the current parameterizations of urban vegetation in CFD modelling and constitutes the starting point for the development of new parametrizations in CFD as well as in mesoscale models.},

abstract = {A new model for radiative transfer in participating media and its application to complex plant canopies is presented. The goal was to be able to efficiently solve complex canopy-scale radiative transfer problems while also representing sub-plant heterogeneity. In the model, individual leaf surfaces are not resolved, but rather vegetation is aggregated into isothermal volumes. Using the leaf angle distribution and leaf area density functions, the volumes realistically augment the radiation field through absorption and anisotropic scattering and re-emission. The volumes are grouped to form individual plants, and individual plants are grouped to form entire canopies. The model increases efficiency by performing ray tracing calculations on graphics processing units (GPUs) using the NVIDIA?? OptiX??? and CUDA??? frameworks, and through efficient algorithms for radiation reflection, scattering, and emission. This efficiency allows for realistic representation of heterogeneity, while also allowing for the solution of problems with very large domains ({\~{}}105 trees) quickly on an inexpensive desktop workstation. Problem execution time scaled nearly linearly with the number of discrete elements in the domain. Model results are compared with experimental data collected from an array of radiation sensors within and above a grapevine canopy and an isolated tree. Agreement between simulated and measured values of shortwave and longwave radiation were very good, with model predictions generally within the expected measurement accuracy.},

abstract = {Xylem and phloem need to maintain steady transport rates of water and carbohydrates to match the exchange rates of these compounds at the leaves. A major proportion of the carbon and nitrogen assimilated by a tree is allocated to the construction and maintenance of the xylem and phloem long distance transport tissues. This proportion can be expected to increase with increasing tree size due to the growing transport distances between the assimilating tissues, i.e., leaves and fine roots, at the expense of their growth. We formulated whole tree level scaling relations to estimate how xylem and phloem volume, nitrogen content and hydraulic conductance scale with tree size, and how these properties are distributed along a tree height. Xylem and phloem thicknesses and nitrogen contents were measured within varying positions in four tree species from Southern Finland. Phloem volume, nitrogen amount and hydraulic conductance were found to be concentrated toward the branch and stem apices, in contrast to the xylem where these properties were more concentrated toward the tree base. All of the species under study demonstrated very similar trends. Total nitrogen amount allocated to xylem and phloem was predicted to be comparable to the nitrogen amount allocated to the leaves in small and medium size trees, and to increase significantly above the nitrogen content of the leaves in larger trees. Total volume, hydraulic conductance and nitrogen content of the xylem were predicted to increase faster than that of the phloem with increasing tree height in small trees ({\textless}{\~{}}10 m in height). In larger trees, xylem sapwood turnover to heartwood, if present, would maintain phloem conductance at the same level with xylem conductance with further increases in tree height. Further simulations with a previously published xylem-phloem transport model demonstrated that the M{\"{u}}nch pressure flow hypothesis could explain phloem transport with increasing tree height even for the tallest trees.},

The benefits of green roofs are unquestionable from the thermal point of view. But some quantitative data on this subject are still needed in the context of tropical climate. Therefore, a field measurement was conducted in Singapore to investigate the thermal impacts of rooftop garden. From the derived data, it has been confirmed that rooftop gardens contribute thermal benefits to both buildings and their surrounding environments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

By matching the refractive index of solid boundaries with that of the liquid, unob-structed optical paths can be achieved for illumination and image acquisition. In this research note, we extend previ-ously provided data for the refractive index of aqueous solutions of sodium iodide (NaI) for concentrations reaching the temperature-dependent solubility limit. Results are fitted onto a quadratic empirical expression relating the concentration to the refractive index. Tem-perature effects are also measured. The present range of indices, 1.333–1.51, covers that of typical transparent sol-ids, from silicone elastomers to several recently introduced materials that could be manufactured using rapid proto-typing. We also review briefly previous measurements of the refractive index, viscosity, and density of NaI solutions, as well as prior research that has utilized this fluid.},

abstract = {We developed a method for reconstructing tree crown volume from a set of eight photographs taken from the N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE and SW. This photographic method of reconstruction includes three steps. First, canopy height and diameter are estimated from each image from the location of the topmost, rightmost and leftmost vegetated pixel; second, a rectangular bounding box around the tree is constructed from canopy dimensions derived in Step 1, and the bounding box is divided into an array of voxels; and third, each tree image is divided into a set of picture zones. The gap fraction of each picture zone is calculated from image processing. A vegetated picture zone corresponds to a gap fraction of less than 1. Each picture zone corresponds to a beam direction from the camera to the target tree, the equation of which is computed from the zone location on the picture and the camera parameters. For each vegetated picture zone, the ray-box intersection algorithm (Glassner 1989) is used to compute the sequence of voxels intersected by the beam. After processing all vegetated zones, voxels that have not been intersected by any beam are presumed to be empty and are removed from the bounding box. The estimation of crown volume can be refined by combining several photographs from different view angles. The method has been implemented in a software package called Tree Analyzer written in C++. The photographic method was tested with three-dimensional (3D) digitized plants of walnut, peach, mango and olive. The 3D-digitized plants were used to estimate crown volume directly and generate virtual perspective photographs with POV-Ray Version 3.5 (Persistence of Vision Development Team). The locations and view angles of the camera were manually controlled by input parameters. Good agreement between measured data and values inferred from the photographic method were found for canopy height, diameter and volume. The effects of voxel size, size of picture zoning, location of camera and number of pictures were also examined.},

abstract = {Wind-driven rain (WDR) is one of the most important moisture sources with potential negative effects on hygrothermal performance and durability of buildings. The impact of WDR on building facades can be understood in a better way by predicting the surface wetting distribution accurately. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation with the Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) method has been widely used and validated by several researchers for different isolated building configurations. In this paper, Eulerian Multiphase modeling (EM) for WDR assessment is applied and validated for a monumental tower building (St. Hubertus building in The Netherlands). The LPT and EM models show comparable results and EM is validated by comparison of the calculated catch ratio values with available experimental data on windward facade. The deviations between the experimental and the model results at low rain intensity and wind speed are attributed to the absence of turbulent dispersion in both LPT and EM models. EM has the advantages, first, of less computational complexity and faster pre-processing and post-processing in terms of raindrop trajectories and WDR catch ratios, and second, of allowing the calculation of catch ratios on all surfaces of a complex geometry over the domain at once. The user time spent for the simulation decreases by at least a factor of 10 using EM instead of LPT for a single building. Additionally, the EM is expected to provide a sound basis for future WDR studies incorporating more accurate calculation of the wind flow field, e.g. by LES and the inclusion of turbulent dispersion. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Are the natural resources available, such as land and water, sufficient to feed a growing population? What role can economic incentives and technical change play in shaping resource use and supply? What are the priority areas where investment and research should be directed? How may the use of agricultural products in biofuel production affect markets? And how can climate change affect production possibilities and markets? Around these questions, in 2009, FAO's Economic and Social Development Department organized a Forum and a High-Level Expert Meeting on How to Feed The World in 2050. This volume follows up on that initiative, by gathering updated versions of technical materials prepared for the occasion, along with further work. the book seeks to sustain the debate on the future of the global agricultural and food economy. Its contents were designed to interest both a technical audience and a wider range of professionals working around the world in areas related to agriculture, in both public and private institutions.},

abstract = {Convective heat and mass exchange of leaves with the environment is relevant for a better understanding of plant physiological processes in response to environmental factors for a wide range of applications. Methods for quantifying these exchanges have been a subject of active research, as they allow to explain the functions of leaves, their effects on gas and water transport in plants and the heat and mass exchange of plant canopies with the environment. Furthermore, they provide input on these exchange rates to simulation models of pre- and postharvest operations and of leaf/plant/tree/canopy-environment systems. An overview is given on the different methods to obtain convective transfer predictions, namely analytical, experimental (i.e., by laboratory or field tests) and numerical methods, and their restrictions and current knowledge gaps are identified. Analytical methods for flat plates are the most simplified approach but lack physical similarity with real leaves. The majority of the methods used are however sensor-based, using real, artificial but also virtual leaf sensors. For experimental research in the field or in the laboratory (e.g., wind tunnel), special attention is given here to the sensors used, namely real and artificial leaves. Numerical methods are based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to predict air-side convective transfer on virtual leaves, but have not been readily applied at leaf and sub-leaf level, despite their large potential here. Instead of commonly-used convective transfer coefficients, CFD allows direct, case-specific predictions of convective transfer, at different levels of complexity and at a very high spatial and temporal resolution. A particular difficulty in all methods is to account for stomata, which result in very heterogeneous heat and mass boundary conditions over the leaf surface at microscale level, and also for microscale surface roughness (e.g., trichomes). Future perspectives are mainly oriented towards CFD, but the challenge will be to model convective transfer at multiple scales and to couple them using a multiscale approach. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This study used police crime reports to examine the relationship between vegetation and crime in an inner-city neighborhood. Crime rates for 98 apartment buildings with varying levels of nearby vegetation were compared. Results indicate that although residents were randomly assigned to different levels of nearby vegetation, the greener a building's surroundings were, the fewer crimes reported. Furthermore, this pattern held for both property crimes and violent crimes. The relationship of vegetation to crime held after the number of apartments per building, building height, vacancy rate, and number of occupied units per building were accounted for.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for a substantial amount of the water flux in the arid and semi-arid regions of the World. Accurate estimation of ET has been a challenge for hydrologists, mainly because of the spatiotemporal variability of the environmental and physical parameters governing the latent heat flux. In addition, most available ET models depend on intensive meteorological information for ET estimation. Such data are not available at the desired spatial and temporal scales in less developed and remote parts of the world. This limitation has necessitated the development of simple models that are less data intensive and provide ET estimates with acceptable level of accuracy. Remote sensing approach can also be applied to large areas where meteorological data are not available and field scale data collection is costly, time consuming and difficult. In areas like the Rift Valley regions of Ethiopia, the applicability of the Simple Method (Abtew Method) of lake evaporation estimation and surface energy balance approach using remote sensing was studied. The Simple Method and a remote sensing-based lake evaporation estimates were compared to the Penman, Energy balance, Pan, Radiation and Complementary Relationship Lake Evaporation (CRLE) methods applied in the region. Results indicate a good correspondence of the models outputs to that of the above methods. Comparison of the 1986 and 2000 monthly lake ET from the Landsat images to the Simple and Penman Methods show that the remote sensing and surface energy balance approach is promising for large scale applications to understand the spatial variation of the latent heat flux.},

abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli.},

Concentrations increased strongly on the upstream side of the canyon, while on the downstream side a small concentration decrease could be observed. Lower flow velocities and higher pollutant concentrations were found in the numerical simulations when directly compared to the experimental results. However, the impact of tree planting on airflow and concentration fields when compared to the treeless street canyon as a reference configuration were simulated quite well, meaning that relative changes were similar in the wind tunnel investigations and numerical computations.

abstract = {Non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and stochastic collocation (SC) methods are attractive techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to their strong mathematical basis and ability to produce functional representations of stochastic variability. PCE estimates coefficients for known orthogonal polynomial basis functions based on a set of response function evaluations, using sampling, linear regression, tensor-product quadra- ture, or Smolyak sparse grid approaches. SC, on the other hand, forms interpolation functions for known coefficients, and requires the use of structured collocation point sets derived from tensor product or sparse grids. When tailoring the basis functions or interpo- lation grids to match the forms of the input uncertainties, exponential convergence rates can be achieved with both techniques for a range of probabilistic analysis problems. In addition, analytic features of the expansions can be exploited for moment estimation and stochastic sensitivity analysis. In this paper, the latest ideas for tailoring these expansion methods to numerical integration approaches will be explored, in which expansion formula- tions are modified to best synchronize with tensor-product quadrature and Smolyak sparse grids using linear and nonlinear growth rules. The most promising stochastic expansion ap- proaches are then carried forward for use in new approaches for mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ, employing second-order probability approaches, and design under uncertainty, employing bilevel, sequential, and multifidelity approaches.Hierarchische},

However, materi- als currently in use are usually rigid and matched to liquids that are either expensive or highly viscous. This does not allow for measurements at high Reynolds number, nor accurate modeling of flexible structures. This work explores the use of two hydrogels (agarose and poly- acrylamide) as refractive-index-matched models in water. These hydrogels are inexpensive, can be cast into desired shapes, and have flexibility that can be tuned to match biological materials. The use of water as the fluid phase allows this method to be implemented immediately in many experimental facilities and permits investigation of high-Reynolds-number phenomena. We explain fabrication methods and present a summary of the physical and optical properties of both gels, and then show measurements demonstrating the use of hydrogel models in quantitative imaging. 1},

In addition, a further sink was added to the k- and ??-budget equations to account for the additional loss of turbulence energy. The flow equations were solved using the PHOENICS fluid dynamic program by adding the necessary source/sink terms into the standard k-?? turbulence model. The thermal stratification is not included in the model simulation and wind tunnel experiment. Predictions from the model were compared against wind tunnel data, and good agreement was observed. Moreover, three different canopy shapes of the forest were introduced into the simulation. With the wind tunnel data as a reference, their results were compared and some useful conclusions were drawn. Finally, a design case study analyzed the effect of canopies on the wind environment of urban micro-climates. It showed that the developed tree canopy model is applicable in the design and evaluation stage.},

abstract = {Rainwater runoff from building facades is a complex process governed by a wide range of urban, building, material and meteorological parameters. Given this complexity and the wide range of influencing parameters, it is not surprising that despite research efforts spanning over almost a century, wind-driven rain and rainwater runoff are still very active research subjects. Accurate knowledge of rainwater runoff is important for hygrothermal and durability analyses of building facades, assessment of indirect evaporative cooling by water films on facades to mitigate outdoor and indoor overheating, assessment of the self-cleaning action of facade surface coatings and leaching of particles from surface coatings that enter the water cycle as hazardous pollutants. Research on rainwater runoff is performed by field observations, field measurements, laboratory measurements and analytical and numerical modelling. While field observations are many, up to now, field experiments and modelling efforts are few and have been almost exclusively performed for plain facades without facade details. Field observations, often based on a posteriori investigation of the reasons for differential surface soiling, are important because they have provided and continue to provide very valuable qualitative information on runoff, which is very difficult to obtain in any other way. Quantitative measurements are increasing, but are still very limited in relation to the wide range of influencing parameters. To the knowledge of the authors, current state-of-the-art hygrothermal models do not yet contain runoff models. The development, validation and implementation of such models into hygrothermal models is required to supplement observational and experimental research efforts. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry is a new experimental method developed to study three-dimensional motion in turbulent flows. The technique is an extension of standard PIV and makes use of several simultaneous views of illuminated tracer particles and their three-dimensional reconstruction as a light intensity distribution by means of tomography. The reconstructed tomogram pair is then analyzed by means of 3D cross-correlation returning the three-component velocity vector distribution over the measurement volume. The principles and details of the tomographic algorithm are discussed and a parametric study is carried out by to identify the most important parameters governing the experimental setup and to show their effect on the reconstruction accuracy. The capability of the technique in real experimental conditions is assessed with the measurement of the turbulent flow in the near wake of a circular cylinder. Next, this new technique has been applied to study the three-dimensional coherent structures in turbulent boundary layers. Quantitative visualizations of the individual (hairpin) vortices as well as the large-scale structures in both a low speed turbulent boundary layer and a high Reynolds number supersonic boundary layer have been obtained. The high Reynolds number data also suggests a very-large-scale flow organization exists not only in streamwise direction but also in spanwise direction. These very-large scale motions appear to consist of large-scale hairpins, which display a preferential alignment in streamwise direction and in the spanwise direction along the 45 degrees diagonal with the respect to the streamwise direction. Moreover, the time evolution of the flow structures is visualized in an experiment, in which the Tomographic-PIV technique is applied to nearly time-resolved image sequences recorded at 1.5 kHz.},

abstract = {Unstable and mechanically demanding habitats like wind-exposed open fields or the wave-swept intertidal require rapid adaptive processes to ensure survival. The mechanism of passive reconfiguration was analyzed in two plant models exposed to irregular flow of water or air, two species of the brown seaweed Durvillaea and the giant reed Arundo donax. Irrespective of the surrounding media and the subsequent Reynolds numbers (Re similar to 10(5)-10(7)), reconfiguration seems to be the key strategy for streamlining to avoid overcritical drag-induced loads. This passive mechanism is also discussed in the context of the requirement of a maximized surface area for light interception, so that morphological adaptations to rapid reconfiguration represent at least a bifactorial optimization. Both tested plant models exhibited the same principles in streamlining. At a specific threshold value, the proportionality between drag forces and flow velocity can be reduced from the second power close to an almost linear relation. This empirically derived relation could be characterized by a figure of merit or Vogel number (B). A value close to B = -1, resulting in a linear increase of drag force with velocity, was found at higher velocities for both the seaweeds and the giant reed, as well as for a variety of plants described in the literature. It is therefore concluded that the ability to reduce velocity-dependent drag force to a linear relation is a potentially important adaptation for plants to survive in unstable flow-dominated habitats.},

abstract = {Coherent structures dominate the shear flow in and above the vegetation canopy, affecting the transport of passive scalars. Their detailed understanding is therefore of great interest for a number of environmental studies such as organic gas exchange, pollution dispersion, or forest fire propagation. In the present study, a forest embedded in an atmospheric boundary layer was reproduced in a wind tunnel. An area source was installed to mimic the volatile organic compounds emission coming from the vegetation. A fast gas analyser combined to a triple hot-wire anemometer were used to measure simultaneously and at the same point the momentum and the concentration fluxes above the canopy. This particular set-up enabled the complex scalar exchange mechanism to be studied in the well defined and stationary boundary conditions of a laboratory experiment simulating neutral atmospheric conditions. Measurements showed that the contribution of coherent structures to the momentum and the concentration flux was 80{\%} and 60{\%} respectively. Contributions were found to be nearly constant with height. The combination of velocity and concentration measurements enabled the determination of the mean concentration of the coherent structures. Results highlights the preponderant role of ejections in releasing highly concentrated gas pockets above the forest canopy. These releases were measured to be, in average, 40{\%} more concentrated than the average gas concentration at the same height. It is shown that 70{\%} of the extreme events observed are linked to an ejection process.},

abstract = {A nested Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to compute the multiscale interaction between the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and an existing cluster of buildings over the real topography. A Neutral ABL (NBL) and a Convective ABL (CBL) are simulated. As the ABLs develop over a no-flat terrain with heterogeneous roughness elements, standard ABL-LES with cyclic boundary condition cannot be used. Instead, a synthetic inflow generator is used to generate realistic turbulent NBL and CBL over the real terrain. The outer domain of the nested-LES is dedicated to solve the ABL flow, with the building parametrized with a rough wall model, whereas the inner domain computes the flow through the cluster of buildings. Both LES are connected with a one-way downscale nesting procedure. The effects of the NBL and the CBL are clearly visible at building scale. The horizontal turbulent flux and the vertical turbulent flux are enhanced in the CBL compared to the NBL. The temperature difference between the air within the cluster of buildings and the rural surrounding is similar for both ABL condition, even if the turbulent mixing is higher in the CLB case. We further show that the critical part of the nested simulation is the ability of the ABL-LES to properly compute the roughness layer near the ground. Current rough wall models used to parametrize urban area are not able to reproduce such layer, which can negatively impact the flow inside the building-resolved LES.},

Barrier models consisting of horizontal bars with different inclination angles are considered.

The aim is to conduct an experimental and numerical study of a fluid flow through the geometrically accurate three-dimensional barrier model and analyze the bar inclination effect on the wake characteristics behind the barrier.

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of site, fertilisation and age on fibre length and develop predictive models of fibre length from a comprehensive set of climatic, edaphic and stand variables. Data were collected from a nationwide set of 22 site quality plots where Pinus radiata D. Don was established at high stand densities (40 000 stems ha-1) and grown over a period of 4 years. The main environmental drivers of fibre length were identified by assessing the strength of bivariate correlations and use of multiple regression. Path analysis was used as an extension to multiple regression to separate cause from effect and quantify the direct influence of variables significantly related to fibre length. Fibre length exhibited significant variation between sites. When averaged across fertiliser treatments, site variation for fibre length in rings 1-4 ranged from 1.08 to 1.76 mm. Fertilisation did not significantly affect fibre length. Fibre length significantly increased with age from an average of 1.10 mm in rings 1-2 to 1.62 mm in rings 3-4. The interaction between age and fertilisation was insignificant. In total 16 variables were significantly related to fibre length. For rings 1-4, fibre length exhibited the strongest significant relationships with stem slenderness (r = 0.69), mean minimum air temperature (r = 0.67), green crown height (r = 0.66), tree height (r = 0.64) and average air temperature (r = 0.62). The best multiple regression models for both age classes and the whole stem included mean minimum air temperature and stem slenderness in a linear formulation. Path analysis indicated that the direct positive contribution of both these variables to fibre length was of a similar magnitude (path coefficients of 0.52 versus 0.49). Significant determinants of P. radiata fibre length in our study were similar to those identified in trees grown at conventional stockings across a similar environmental gradient in New Zealand. Although these studies did not examine how stem slenderness influences fibre length, they found average air temperature to be the strongest environmental determinant of fibre length, and that soil fertility, as indexed by Olsen phosphorus and total nitrogen and pH had little influence on fibre length. Further research is needed in conventionally stocked stands to confirm the link found here between stem slenderness and fibre length. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The epistemic uncertainty in the free coefficients of two popular Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity turbulence models is quantified. In particular, the Launder-Sharma low-Reynolds K-?? and the Menter K-?? SST models are considered. The free coefficients present in turbulence models are retrieved from some properties of benchmark turbulent flows, viz. the energy power law exponent for decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the value of the Von Karman constant, the turbulence production over dissipation rate estimated in the asymptotic regime of a homogeneous shear flow and the dimensionless turbulent kinetic energy in the logarithmic layer. The values presented in literature for these quantities, obtained from experiments or direct numerical simulations (DNS), show a significant dispersion, indicating the presence of an epistemic uncertainty. Starting from the data collected in literature, realistic continuous probability density functions of the basic flow properties, and hence of the RANS model coefficients, are obtained through generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC). The impact of this uncertainty on the results of RANS simulations of the turbulent channel flow is then investigated for different Reynolds numbers through comparison with DNS data. The solution over the continuous multi-dimensional uncertainty space of the considered random variables is reconstructed through the application of a surrogate model (response surface) obtained by means of gPC. In general, the predictions of the K-?? SST model are less sensitive to the uncertainty in the model parameters than those of the low-Reynolds K-?? model. For both models and for any combination of the coefficients, the predictions of the turbulent kinetic energy profile are not satisfactory, while low errors can be obtained for friction and mean velocity. Evaluation of optimal values of free parameters is a Data Assimilation (DA) problem. An example of the use of the gPC response surface for an efficient calibration of the model coefficients in order to minimize the error in the prediction of these two last variables is provided. The result accuracy estimated through the gPC surrogate model well agrees with that obtained in deterministic simulations carried out with the calibrated values of the model constants.},

Drag coefficients for two simple solid geometric forms (cone and cylinder) having approximately the same size(height and diameter) as the conifer trees were also measured over a relatively wide range of Reynolds numbers and the results compared to published drag curves for these shapes. The field study found that the porous element had a higher drag coefficient than a solid element, both for the solid element tested and for the drag coefficient suggested for surface-mounted solid obstacles. The drag coefficient changed on a continuum with porosity, rising initially from the value measured for the element as a solid, reaching a peak at an intermediate value and eventually falling to zero when the element was removed. This peak in the drag coefficient versus porosity curve corresponds to reports that shelterbelt efficiency peaks at medium-porosities, and is an important relationship in terms of modelling momentum extraction of vegetation, one which has not been shown previously in the literature. Findings of this study have direct application to the modelling of shelterbelts and windbreaks and the assessment of the amount of vegetation cover required to suppress wind erosion in rangeland vegetation communities.

abstract = {Vegetation covers in urban parks are very useful for providing a cool microclimate which mitigates urban heat islands (UHIs). The objectives of this investigation are to therefore conduct on-site measurements and computational fluid dynamic simulations to evaluate the cooling efficacy from vegetation planted in a public park in Taipei, which is a subtropical city in Taiwan. The thermo-flow characteristics are predicted and compared with the measured air velocity and temperature data by using ultrasonic anemometers and an infrared camera to validate the computer modeling, including the sophisticated configurations of trees. Computations are also conducted to resolve the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) profiles for assessing the thermal comfort state at the pedestrian level of the outdoor environment. To investigate the impacts of park renewal on the urban microclimate, three pavilions and supplementary green areas are added to the simulation, and the results reveal that there is a better cooling effect in the park with a higher green coverage ratio (GCR). Moreover, the simulations find that the increased tree coverage ratio can more than compensate for loss of coverage of grasses, resulting in an overall decrease in average temperature. The relationship between thermal comfortable area and green coverage ratio tends to be nonlinear in nature. However, it would be more convenient for applications to adopt the linear regression analysis for determining the correlation between the GCR and PET for the percentage of areas that are comfortable (Cf). It shows that Cf=0.96×GCR+5.08, with a reasonable R2 value of 0.91, for GCR ranged from 54.5 to 71.6{\%}, indicating that there is a significant reduced UHI effect with increases in the GCR. In addition, the correlation implies that a completely thermally comfortable condition will prevail in the park if it has full green coverage. This correlation thus serves as an important guideline for urban planners and managers when designing and managing public urban spaces, such as parks.},

We present a method for using real-time neutron radiography to measure rapidly changing moisture profiles in porous media. The imaging technique monitors the attenuation of a thermal neutron beam as it traverses a flow field and provides measurements every 30 ms with an image area {\textgreater}410 cm2 and a spatial resolution ???0.05 cm. The technique is illustrated by measuring the variation in moisture content across a wetting front moving at constant velocity through SiO2 sand. The relative contributions of the hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity terms in Richards' equation to the total fluid flux within the wetting front region were also measured. The diffusivity was found to rise from zero to a peak value within the wetting front region before falling off while the conductivity was found to rise monotonically. The reliability of the technique was checked via mass balance. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The new eddy viscosity formulation is based on the realizability constraints; the positivity of normal Reynolds stresses and the Schwarz' inequality for turbulent shear stresses. We find that the present model with a set of unified model coefficients can perform well for a variety of flows. The flows that are examined include: (i) rotating homogeneous shear flows; (ii) boundary-free shear flows including a mixing layer, planar and round jets; (iii) a channel flow, and flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient; and (iv) backward facing step separated flows. The model predictions are compared with available experimental data. The results from the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model are also included for comparison. It is shown that the present model is a significant improvement over the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model.},

abstract = {The k-??{\{}lunate{\}} model is routinely used by wind engineers to computationally model the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Commercial software is typically used, with the default law of the wall used to model the rough ground surface. By setting appropriate profiles for wind velocity and the turbulence quantities at the inlet, it is often assumed that the boundary layer will be maintained up to the buildings or obstructions in the flow. This paper shows that this is not the case, even in the absence of obstructions, and that the velocity and turbulence profiles decay along the fetch under these default conditions. By revisiting previous work, it is shown that the neutral ABL can be maintained along a lengthy fetch but only with a modified law of the wall and with a shear stress applied to the top boundary of the domain. For those practitioners who are not able to adopt this more thorough approach, some measures are suggested to mitigate the decay of the boundary layer. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two averaging schemes are considered: pure horizontal averaging at a single instant, and time averaging followed by horizontal averaging. These schemes produce different forms for the mean and turbulent kinetic energy balances, and especially for the ‘wake production' term describing the transfer of energy from large-scale motion to wake turbulence by form drag. The.differences are primarily due to the appearance, in the covariances produced by the second scheme, of dispersive components arising from the spatial corre- lation of time-averaged flow variables.

abstract = {In order to develop climate resilient urban areas and reduce emissions, several opportunities exist starting from conscious planning and design of green (and blue) spaces in these landscapes. Green urban infrastructure has been regarded as beneficial, e.g. by balancing water flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e.g. CO2sequestration) as well as social and psychological benefits (e.g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of green urban infrastructure complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from green urban infrastructures on three spatial scales (i.e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions. The manuscript identifies avenues for further research on the role of green urban infrastructure, in different types of cities, climates and social contexts. Our systematic understanding of the bio-physical and social processes defining various services allows targeting stressors that may hamper the provision of green urban infrastructure services in individual behavior as well as in wider planning and environmental management in urban areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Below-ground characteristics of five Populus clones, belonging to different species and parentages, were studied during the second growing season of the third rotation of a high-density coppice culture. Size (length, area and volume), biomass, nitrogen and carbon concentrations of three classes of fine roots (diameter classes of 0-1, 1-2 and 2-5 mm) were determined for four different soil layers. Fine root biomass varied significantly among clones and among soil layers. Clone Primo (Populus deltoides×Populus nigra) had the highest root biomass and the longest fine roots, while clone Hazendans (Populus trichocarpa×P. deltoides) had the lowest root biomass and shortest fine roots. The topsoil layer (0-5 cm) was very rich in fine roots; the fine root biomass and distribution of all clones decreased with increasing soil depth. Fine root area index (diameter classes of 0-1 and 1-2 mm) varied among clones, with higher values for clones Wolterson and Primo (3.6 and 3.7, respectively), while clones Hazendans and Columbia River had lower values (1.7 and 2.2, respectively). The absence of a significant correlation between fine root traits and above-ground biomass leads to the conclusion that above-ground biomass was not a reliable indicator of below-ground biomass in poplar, probably because of the age of the plantation in our study (stump age of 10 years). Fine root area index was positively correlated with leaf area index for all clones and at all soil depths, i.e., clones with a high fine root area index also had a high leaf area index. We conclude that leaf area index can be an indicator of root area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. The sorption and swelling behavior of heterogeneous spruce wood samples is documented with high-resolution phase-contrast X-ray tomography combined with a dynamic vapor sorption analysis. Three samples extracted at the growth ring boundary contain almost equivalent volumes of earlywood and latewood tissues. The anisotropic swelling behavior of cellular wood material with different geometries and porosities is reported. In particular, the swelling anisotropy ratio in heterogeneous tissues is lower than the one seen in homogeneous wood specimens. This means that, due to the restraining effect of latewood on earlywood and vice versa, swelling of combined wood reduces and becomes less anisotropic. Hysteresis is no longer present when the affine swelling/shrinkage strain is considered as a function of moisture content, indicating that the same amount of moisture entering or exiting the cell wall material leads to the same swelling/shrinkage deformation of the cell material. Nevertheless, looking at non-affine deformations, using a modified B-spline algorithm, a local bending with respect to the latewood–earlywood interface is documented. In addition, the role of rays in the cellular structure in restraining the tangential swelling of thin-cell-walled earlywood is revealed. Finally, the swelling behavior of a greenwood sample is studied at cellular scale. The first desorption curve shows shrinkage strains that are not recovered under hygroscopic loading, and a similar, but of lesser magnitude, restraining effect is seen.},

abstract = {An accurate description of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is a prerequisite for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind studies. This includes taking into account the thermal stability of the atmosphere, which can be stable, neutral or unstable, depending on the nature of the surface fluxes of momentum and heat. The surface fluxes and vertical profiles of wind velocity and temperature are described by Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. The implementation of this thermally stratified atmosphere into CFD has been examined in this study by using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, and the commercial code STAR-CCM+. The maintenance of the temperature, velocity and turbulence profiles along an extensive computational domain length was required, while simultaneously allowing for full variation in pressure and density through the ideal gas law. Effects of gravity and buoyancy were included, leading to the emergence of the hydrostatic pressure field and the resultant density changes expected in the real atmosphere. The CFD model was tested against measured data, from the literature, for the flow over a cosine hill in a wind tunnel. The standard k−$\epsilon$ and SST k−$\omega$ turbulence models represented the data most accurately. The flow over an idealised transverse dune immersed in the thermally stratified ABL was also investigated. It was found that the flow recovery was enhanced and re-attachment occurred earlier in unstable conditions, while flow recovery and re-attachment took longer in stable conditions. The effect of the dune on the flow higher up in the atmosphere was also felt at much higher distances for unstable conditions, through enhanced vertical velocities. Under stable conditions vertical velocities were reduced. This confirmed that the assumption of neutral conditions could lead to an incomplete picture of the flow conditions that influence any particular case of interest.},

Downstream of a short initial decay region, where the intensities decrease rapidly, the return to isotropy was found to be much slower than for the unmanipulated turbulence. The latter was generated by a square rod grid, and was shown to become practically isotropic beyond a distance of roughly 20 mesh widths from the grid.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Global climate models predict decreases in leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration due to increases in atmospheric CO2. The consequences of these reductions are increases in soil moisture availability and continental scale run-off at decadal time-scales. Thus, a theory explaining the differential sensitivity of stomata to changing atmospheric CO2 and other environmental conditions must be identified. Here, these responses are investigated using optimality theory applied to stomatal conductance. METHODS An analytical model for stomatal conductance is proposed based on: (a) Fickian mass transfer of CO2 and H2O through stomata; (b) a biochemical photosynthesis model that relates intercellular CO2 to net photosynthesis; and (c) a stomatal model based on optimization for maximizing carbon gains when water losses represent a cost. Comparisons between the optimization-based model and empirical relationships widely used in climate models were made using an extensive gas exchange dataset collected in a maturing pine (Pinus taeda) forest under ambient and enriched atmospheric CO2. Key Results and Conclusion In this interpretation, it is proposed that an individual leaf optimally and autonomously regulates stomatal opening on short-term (approx. 10-min time-scale) rather than on daily or longer time-scales. The derived equations are analytical with explicit expressions for conductance, photosynthesis and intercellular CO2, thereby making the approach useful for climate models. Using a gas exchange dataset collected in a pine forest, it is shown that (a) the cost of unit water loss lambda (a measure of marginal water-use efficiency) increases with atmospheric CO2; (b) the new formulation correctly predicts the condition under which CO2-enriched atmosphere will cause increasing assimilation and decreasing stomatal conductance.},

Results of the tests are compared where possible with existing field and wind-tunnel data, with due regard for the uncertainty of hot-wire anemometer measurements in a bluff body wake. The turbulence measurements define the leeward flow regions which are dominated respectively by the bleed flow and by the displacement flow. For these two regions separate empirical relationships between mean velocity and turbulence intensity are given. In these tests the 20{\%} permeable fence gave the best overall reduction in leeward mean velocity. However, in practice it may often be more cost-effective to build a relatively higher fence of greater permeability.},

In addition, the simulation results indicate that, at least for the cases studied here, the increase of wind speed in passages is only pronounced at the pedestrian level and that the flow rate through the passage is at most only 8{\%} higher than the free-field flow rate, indicating that the so-called Venturi-effect is rather weak. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Possible trade-offs between hydraulic conductivity and mechanical properties of woody stems from five species were assessed. Acer negundo is a ruderal tree, A. saccharinum, and A. rubrum are fast-growing and shade-intolerant soft maples, whereas A. nigrum and A. saccharum are slow-growing and shade-tolerant hard maples. It was hypothesized that the ruderal and soft maples would have lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), but higher maximum specific conductivity (Ks max) than hard maples. Many anatomical and general morphological characteristics were measured in an attempt to correlate them to water transport and/or mechanical strength differences between species. No difference was found between species in vessel diameter, fiber wall thickness, initial hydraulic conductivity (Kh initial), specific conductivity (Ks max), native percent embolism, or Huber value. Similarly, no trade-off was found between Ks max and MOE or MOR across the genus. However, fiber lumen diameter was inversely correlated to MOE and MOR. Surprisingly, percentage of ray parenchyma was positively related to MOE. The results suggest transport/mechanical trade-offs do not occur in Acer and differences in mechanical properties may be due to fiber lumen differences that do not influence the efficient transport of water.},

abstract = {The potential of a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model to reliably predict near-field pollutant dispersion is assessed. To that extent, detailed time-resolved numerical simulations of coupled flow and dispersion are conducted for a street canyon with tree planting. Different crown porosities are considered. The model performance is assessed in several steps, ranging from a qualitative comparison to measured concentrations, over statistical data analysis by means of scatter plots and box plots, up to the calculation of objective validation metrics. The extensive validation effort highlights and quantifies notable features and shortcomings of the model, which would otherwise remain unnoticed. The model performance is found to be spatially non-uniform. Closer agreement with measurement data is achieved near the canyon ends than for the central part of the canyon, and typical model acceptance criteria are satisfied more easily for the leeward than for the windward canyon wall. This demonstrates the need for rigorous model evaluation. Only quality-assured models can be used with confidence to support assessment, planning and implementation of pollutant mitigation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a combination of two models to study both the impingement and the contact and surface phenomena of rainwater on a glass window surface: a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the calculation of the distribution of the wind-driven rain (WDR) across the building facade and a semi-empirical droplet-behaviour model. The CFD model comprises the calculation of the wind-flow pattern, the raindrop trajectories and the specific catch ratio as a measure of the WDR falling onto different parts of the facade. The droplet-behaviour model uses the output of the CFD model to simulate the behaviour of individual raindrops on the window glass surface, including runoff, coalescence and drying. The models are applied for a small window glass surface of a two-storey building. It is shown that by far not all WDR that impinges on a glass surface runs off, due to evaporation of drops adhered to the surface. The reduction of runoff by evaporation is 26{\%} for a typical cumuliform rain event and 4{\%} for a typical stratiform rain event. These models can be used to provide the knowledge about WDR impact, runoff and evaporation that is needed for the performance assessment of self-cleaning glass or the study of the leaching of nanoparticles from building facades.},

abstract = {Canopy surface resistances (rs) for nine ornamental species (begonia, cyclamen, gardenia, gloxinia, hibiscus, impatiens, pelargonium, poinsettia and schefflera) were deduced from measurements of stand evapotranspiration (E) and used with the Penman-Monteith equation to predict hourly rates of E. A multiplicative relationship was used to express rs as a function of solar irradiance (G) and vapour pressure deficit (D). For most of the species, rs showed a high correlation with solar irradiance, except for begonia which had a significant correlation between rs and D, and poinsettia which had a low correlation of rs with both G and D. Minimum leaf stomatal resistance (rl,min) and dark resistance, rl,d were deduced from rs formulae. Significant differences were found between species: rl,min ranged from 150 s m-1 (impatiens) to 400 s m-1 (gloxinia), whereas rl,d varied from 1500 s m-1 (cyclamen) to 4500 s m-1 (schefflera). Calculated hourly E rates, gave good agreement with the experimental data. These results show that such a method based on the Penman-Monteith equation and the estimation of rs can be used to predict the short-term evapotranspiration rate of ornamental crops. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The model RATP (radiation absorption, transpiration and photosynthesis) is presented. The model was designed to simulate the spatial distribution of radiation and leaf-gas exchanges within vegetation canopies as a function of canopy structure, canopy microclimate within the canopy and physical and physiological leaf properties. The model uses a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the canopy (i.e. an array of 3D cells, each characterized by a leaf area density). Radiation transfer is computed by a turbid medium analogy, transpiration by the leaf energy budget approach, and photosynthesis by the Farquhar model, each applied for sunlit and shaded leaves at the individual 3D cell-scale. The model typically operates at a 20–30 min time step. The RATP model was applied to an isolated, 20-year-old walnut tree grown in the field. The spatial distribution of wind speed, stomatal response to environmental variables, and light acclimation of leaf photosynthetic properties were taken into account. Model outputs were compared with data acquired in the field. The model was shown to simulate satisfactorily the intracrown distribution of radiation regime, transpiration and photosynthetic rates, at shoot or branch scales.},

abstract = {Natural windbreaks such as trees are very efficient barriers to high velocity winds. The windbreaks exert drag force causing a net loss of momentum and thus disturb the characteristics of flow. The main factors which can affect the efficiency of the windbreaks are tree height, width, tree arrangement, porosity, etc. However, tree porosity which is strongly related to the windbreak drag is very difficult to establish. In this study, the results of a wind tunnel test were introduced to find the aerodynamic porosity and resistance factor of a tree windbreak. Black pine tree (Pinus thunbergii), a typical tree windbreak in Korea was chosen as the experimental tree. With the main factors of wind velocity, static pressure and density of the tree, the aerodynamic porosity as well as the resistance factor of the tree was found. The average porosity at varied tree density were found to be 0.91, 0.69 and 0.42 for one, two and three trees, respectively. The resistance factors which can be equaled to the drag coefficient were 0.55, 0.82 and 1.08 for one, two and three trees, respectively. The determined aerodynamic porosity and windbreak drag will be used later as input data in computer simulation studies such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Moreover, the experimental procedure as well as the use of real trees in the wind tunnel experiment of finding the aerodynamic porosity and windbreak drag of various tree windbreaks was established through this study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The effect of porous wind fences on the wind erosion of small sand particles from a two-dimensional triangular prism pile of sand was investigated experimentally. The mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles measured at the sand pile location were simulated to fit to the atmospheric boundary layer over open terrain. Flow visualization was carried out to qualitatively determine the movement of the wind-blown sand particles. In addition, the threshold velocity was measured using a digital image processing system at a range of values of the fence porosity $\epsilon$, particle size Dp and sand pile height h. As a result, various types of particle motion were observed according to the experimental conditions. The fence of porosity $\epsilon$ = 30{\%} was found to have the highest threshold velocity, indicating a good shelter effect for abating wind-blown sand particles. The threshold velocity was found to increase with increasing sand particle diameter. The threshold velocity was also enhanced when the height of the sand pile was lower than the fence height. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To significantly increase the contribution of numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for risk assessment and decision making, it is important to quantitatively measure the impact of uncertainties to assess the reliability and robustness of the results. As unsteady high-fidelity CFD simulations are becoming the standard for industrial applications, reducing the number of required samples to perform sensitivity (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis is an actual engineering challenge. The novel approach presented in this paper is based on an efficient hybridization between the anchored-ANOVA and the POD/Kriging methods, which have already been used in CFD-UQ realistic applications, and the definition of best practices to achieve global accuracy. The anchored-ANOVA method is used to efficiently reduce the UQ dimension space, while the POD/Kriging is used to smooth and interpolate each anchored-ANOVA term. The main advantages of the proposed method are illustrated through four applications with increasing complexity, most of them based on Large-Eddy Simulation as a high-fidelity CFD tool: the turbulent channel flow, the flow around an isolated bluff-body, a pedestrian wind comfort study in a full scale urban area and an application to toxic gas dispersion in a full scale city area. The proposed c-APK method (anchored-ANOVA-POD/Kriging) inherits the advantages of each key element: interpolation through POD/Kriging precludes the use of quadrature schemes therefore allowing for a more flexible sampling strategy while the ANOVA decomposition allows for a better domain exploration. A comparison of the three methods is given for each application. In addition, the importance of adding flexibility to the control parameters and the choice of the quantity of interest (QoI) are discussed. As a result, global accuracy can be achieved with a reasonable number of samples allowing computationally expensive CFD-UQ analysis.},

The relationship between E(act)/E(p) was found to be approximately constant and insensitive to variability in near-surface soil moisture content. To explore this near-constant E(act)/E(p), a model that relates potential and actual transpiration and accounts for root-uptake efficiency, potential transpiration rate, and root-density distribution was proposed and field-tested. The total amount of water consumed by the root system was integrated and compared with eddy-correlation latent heat flux measurements (field scale) and total water storage changes (local scale). Model calculations suggested that the deeper and more efficiency roots are primarily responsible for the total water loss within the root zone when the near-surface soil layer approaches their wilting point.},

It addresses three key illustrations of the success of CWE: (1) the establishment of CWE as an individual research and application area in wind engineering with its own successful conference series under the umbrella of the International Association of Wind Engineering (IAWE); (2) the increasing range of topics covered in CWE; and (3) the history of overview and review papers in CWE. The paper also outlines some of the earliest achievements in CWE and the resulting development of best practice guidelines. It provides some views on the complementary relationship between reduced-scale wind-tunnel testing and CFD. It re-iterates some important quotes made by CWE and/or CFD researchers in the past, many of which are still equally valid today and which are provided without additional comments, to let the quotes speak for themselves. Next, as application examples to the foregoing sections, the paper provides a more detailed view on CFD simulation of pedestrian-level wind conditions around buildings, CFD simulation of natural ventilation of buildings and CFD simulation of wind-driven rain on building facades. Finally, a non-exhaustive perspective on the future of CWE is provided. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Trees are essential in a dense urban environment not only because of their aesthetic value, but also for their cooling effect during hot periods, which impacts directly on the local microclimate. However, certain trees cope better with high urban temperatures than others. Here, we report tree crown temperatures of 10 common tree species frequently planted in Central European cities (in part, supplemented with stomatal conductance data, gs). Parts of the city of Basel, Switzerland (7° 4 1′ E/47 ° 3 4′ N) were scanned from a helicopter using a high-resolution thermal camera. A histogram of the composite image shows peaks at 18° C (water), 26° C (vegetation), 37° C (streets) and a less obvious one at 45° C (roofs). At an ambient temperature of c. 25° C, tree crown temperatures ranged from c. 24° C (Aesculus hippocastanum trees located in a park) to 29° C in Acer platanoides trees, located in a street. Trees in parks were significantly cooler (c. 26° C) than trees surrounded by sealed ground (c. 27° C). The only coniferous species, Pinus sylvestris did not vary in temperature with location (park or street) and exhibited foliage temperature close to air temperature. Generally, small-leaved trees remained cooler than large-leaved trees. Stomatal conductance data collected during similar weather conditions suggest that there was no bias in crown temperatures due to locally different water supply between trees. Although the highest leaf temperatures of individuals of A. platanoides reached over 5 K leaf-to-air temperature difference ($\Delta$ TL - A), we do not expect temperature stress to occur in these conditions. In order to estimate possible effects of future temperature extremes on $\Delta$ TL - A, we evaluated the leaf energy balance for a range of stomatal responses and air temperatures, using leaf size, wind speed and the measured species-specific leaf boundary layer resistance. At an ambient temperature of 40° C, $\Delta$ TL - A ranged from 2 to 5 K when gs was assumed to drop linearly to 50{\%} of its maximum value. When gs was compromised further (20{\%} of species-specific maxima), the difference in $\Delta$ TL - A between species became larger with rising ambient temperature (range 4-10 K). Those species with the lowest leaf temperatures at 25° C were not necessarily coolest at 40° C. Species-specific differences in $\Delta$ TL - A under extreme temperatures as shown here may be useful for urban tree planning in order to optimise management cost and human comfort. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In imaging-based studies of flow around solid objects, it is useful to have materials that are refractive- index-matched to the surrounding fluid. However, materi- als currently in use are usually rigid and matched to liquids that are either expensive or highly viscous. This does not allow for measurements at high Reynolds number, nor accurate modeling of flexible structures. This work explores the use of two hydrogels (agarose and poly- acrylamide) as refractive-index-matched models in water. These hydrogels are inexpensive, can be cast into desired shapes, and have flexibility that can be tuned to match biological materials. The use of water as the fluid phase allows this method to be implemented immediately in many experimental facilities and permits investigation of high-Reynolds-number phenomena. We explain fabrication methods and present a summary of the physical and optical properties of both gels, and then show measurements demonstrating the use of hydrogel models in quantitative imaging. 1},

abstract = {Rapid, reliable and objective estimations of leaf area index (LAI) are essential for numerous studies of atmosphere-vegetation interaction, as LAI is very often a critical parameter in process-based models of vegetation canopy response to global environmental change. This paper reviews current knowledge concerning the use of direct and indirect methods for LAI determination. The value of optical LAI measurements by means of hemispherical photography has already been demonstrated in previous studies. As clumping seems to be the main factor causing errors in indirect LAI estimation, we suggest that the use of a digital camera with high dynamic range has the potential to overcome a number of described technical problems related to indirect LAI estimation. Further testing and defining of a standardised field protocol for digital hemispherical photography is however needed to improve this technique to achieve the standards of an ideal device. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The influence of uncertainties in heat-moisture transport properties, due to measurement errors and material heterogeneity, on the numerical simulation results of convective drying of two capillary-saturated porous materials is investigated by a transport-property parameter analysis (TP-PA), based on the Monte Carlo method. Here, the heat-air-moisture transfer model is evaluated many times, each time using a random set of one or multiple input parameters (i.e. transport properties), by which a stochastic model output is generated. The propagation of these transport-property uncertainties to the hygrothermal behaviour of the drying system is evaluated by statistical analysis of the model simulation output. The spread on the hygrothermal response is found to be strongly material dependent and is related to the dominant mode of moisture transport in the material, i.e. liquid or vapour transport. The TP-PA results clearly indicate that uncertainties in the heat-moisture transport properties can lead to significant differences in drying behaviour predictions, where differences of the total drying time with respect to its mean value up to 200{\%} are found for the materials considered. Therefore, numerical modelling of heat and moisture transport in porous materials should preferably include a quantification of the propagation of these uncertainties, for example by means of the proposed transport-property parameter analysis. Such analysis, however, additionally requires detailed (a priori) experimental material characterisation to determine realistic uncertainty ranges. ?? 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

These obstacles were fabricated using a specialty superabsorbent hydrogel produced through the free-radical copolymerization of sodium acrylate and acrylamide. The optical properties of this gel were found to be nearly identical to those of liquid water. Because of refractive index matching (RIM) of both the fluid and solid media, PIV laser light sheets passed through the obstructions without significant degradation or modification. As a result, all tracer particles suspended in the flow were uniformly illuminated, regardless of their position or proximity relative to individual obstacle features. PIV light sheets were also successfully imaged through the hydrogel, enabling accurate velocity measurement in regions that would otherwise be optically inaccessible. These outcomes were reached without reliance on unconventional fluids or specialized flow facilities. For many experimenters interested in fluid-solid interactions, hydrogel-based RIM may thus be less costly and more adaptable than methods that rely on the existing suite of techniques.},

abstract = {Accurate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow are essential for a wide variety of atmospheric studies including pollutant dispersion and deposition. The accuracy of such simulations can be seriously compromised when wall-function roughness modifications based on experimental data for sand-grain roughened pipes and channels are applied at the bottom of the computational domain. This type of roughness modification is currently present in many CFD codes including Fluent 6.2 and Ansys CFX 10.0, previously called CFX-5. The problems typically manifest themselves as unintended streamwise gradients in the vertical mean wind speed and turbulence profiles as they travel through the computational domain. These gradients can be held responsible-at least partly-for the discrepancies that are sometimes found between seemingly identical CFD simulations performed with different CFD codes and between CFD simulations and measurements. This paper discusses the problem by focusing on the simulation of a neutrally stratified, fully developed, horizontally homogeneous ABL over uniformly rough, flat terrain. The problem and its negative consequences are discussed and suggestions to improve the CFD simulations are made. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Water infiltration into vegetated soils is affected by interactions between soil properties and plant activity. Water uptake by plant roots depends on the soil hydraulic properties and infiltration rate. In turn, roots are important water movers and induce nonuniform water content distributions with consequent impact on the infiltration rate. Our goal was to use neutron radiography to investigate root water uptake during rapid infiltration events and subsequent water redistribution. Neutron radiography is an imaging technique capable of measuring with high spatial and temporal resolution root density, soil structure, and water distributions in the vicinity of roots. We used time-series neutron radiography to image infiltration events in 0.17- by 0.15- by 0.013-m boxes filled with a sand mixture and that contained either lupine (Lupinus L) or maize (Zea mays L) plants. We measured four replications at two stages of plant growth. Neutron radiography can detect small variations in water content with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution. Due to their high water content, roots were easily visible in the radiograms before infiltration. Following calibration, we quantified the water content in the sample during and after each infiltration event. Effects of soil heterogeneities such as thin soil layers were visible, as was water uptake by roots. We observed lower water contents along the main root of lupine during the early stage of infiltration, and slower and more diffuse uptake during the later stages of water redistribution, when the wetting front had propagated downward and the water content in the soil decreased. The observed root water uptake was not uniform but rather was localized in certain regions. For maize we observed a loss of water mainly in the upper part of the root system, closer to the stem ratherthan at root tips. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

This review describes the use of PC expansions for the representation of random variables/fields and discusses their utility for the propagation of uncertainty in computational models, focusing on CFD models. Many CFD applications arc considered, including flow in porous media, incompressible and compressible flows, and thermofluid and reacting flows.

abstract = {Wetting and drying of a hydrophobic, macroporous medium like porous asphalt (PA) are investigated in this study under different environmental loadings. Three different types of porous asphalt, PA4, PA8 and PA11, with different pore size distributions, are used to produce specimens that are sealed on all sides except at the top surface, and are wetted by discrete water droplets or by pouring water from the top. The wet specimens are subjected at the top surface to airflow, at low (1 m/s) or high (3 m/s) wind speeds, and heat from a UV lamp. Gravity-driven imbibition by impinging water droplets is observed only in PA11 specimens due to the presence of large pores with diameters between 2 and 6 mm. However, the drying patterns of all the three types of PA are similar i.e. even after 3.5 h of forced convective and non-isothermal drying, water evaporates only near the top surface. The hydrophobicity of the solid matrix limits the influence of liquid transport on the drying process. Consequently, the dominant drying mechanism found in PA is evaporation at the free surface of water islands within the specimen, followed by water vapor diffusion to the top surface and its subsequent convection by airflow. Therefore, high wind speeds lead to a faster drying only if moisture is concentrated near the top surface of the specimen. In comparison with a previous experiment, it is seen that in PA8 and PA11 specimens, gravity-driven drainage is the most important source of fast moisture removal and has a much shorter time-scale than convective drying.},

abstract = {It has been shown that the spatial configuration of a green area can strongly influence its cooling effect. However, the specific correlation has not been sufficiently studied. To systematically clarify the correlation between the spatial configuration and the cooling effect of green areas, 25 idealized scenarios are designed and simulated using the microclimate model ENVI-met. These 25 scenarios represent green areas with five different spatial configurations (integrated green area, sparse dotted green areas, dense dotted green areas, belt-shaped green areas parallel to wind direction, and belt-shaped green areas vertical to wind direction) and five vegetation types (trees with big canopies, trees with small canopies, hedges and shrubs, 50 cm grass, and 10 cm grass). The human thermal comfort of each scenario is evaluated by means of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) using Rayman. The results reveal the influence of the fragmentation degree (quantified by the patch density and edge density), shape complexity (quantified by the land shape index), orientation of green belt, and vegetation type on the cooling effect of a green area. The spatial configuration and the vegetation type of green areas were found jointly affecting the efficiency of the green areas' cooling effect. The highest cooling effect appears at 2 pm, reaching 6.3 K in the scenario of belt-shaped green areas parallel to the wind direction and with big canopy trees. The conclusions of this paper can provide suggestions for the climate-adaptive design and planning of urban green areas in the future.},

abstract = {A numerical simulation has been performed of the disturbed flow through and over a two-dimensional array of rectangular buildings immersed in a neutrally stratified deep rough-walled turbulent boundary-layer flow. The model used for the simulation was the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with linear and non-linear eddy viscosity formulations for the Reynolds stresses. The eddy viscosity was determined using a high-Reynolds number form of the k-??; turbulence-closure model with the boundary conditions at the wall obtained with a standard wall-function approach. The resulting system of partial differential equations was solved using the SIMPLE algorithm in conjunction with a non-orthogonal, colocated, cell-centered, finite volume procedure. The predictive capabilities of the high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of urban flow are validated against a very detailed and comprehensive wind tunnel data set. Vertical profiles of the mean streamwise velocity and the turbulence kinetic energy are presented and compared to those measured in the wind tunnel simulation. It is found that the performance of all the turbulence models investigated is generally good-most of the qualitative features in the disturbed turbulent flow field through and over the building array are correctly reproduced. The quantitative agreement is also fairly good (especially for the mean velocity field). Overall, the non-linear k-??; model gave the best performance among four different turbulence closure models examined. The turbulence energy levels within the street canyons and in the exit region downstream of the last building were underestimated by all four turbulence closure models. This appears to contradict the 'stagnation point anomaly' associated with the standard k-??; model which is a result of the excessive turbulence energy production due to normal straining. A possible explanation for this is the inability of the present models to account properly for the effects of secondary strains on the turbulence and/or for the effects of large-scale flapping of the strong shear layer at the canopy top. The results of the high-resolution CFD simulations have been used to diagnose values of the drag coefficient to be used in a distributed drag force representation of the obstacles in the array. Comparisons of the measured spatially-averaged time-mean mean velocity and turbulence kinetic energy in the array with predictions of the disturbed flow using the distributed drag force approach have been made. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the porous fence with ?? = 40{\%} has good flow characteristics for abating wind erosion with small turbulent fluctuations and a relatively large reduction in mean velocity. Except for the solid fence (?? = 0{\%}), two shear layers develop from the porous fences. As the fence porosity (??) increases, the height of the shear layer and the streamline curvature decrease. When the porosity (??) is greater than 40{\%}, there is no re-circulation flow behind the fence due to the strong bleed flow, the Reynolds shear stress is nearly negligible in the entire near-wake region and relatively small turbulent kinetic energies are concentrated in the region just behind the fence (x/H {\textless}0.5). When the fence porosity is less than 20{\%}, the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy are strong over the fence and in the shear layer near the reattachment region.},

abstract = {A comparative assessment of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) two-equation k - e{\{}open{\}} model, with different proposals for a proper treatment of the vegetation (trees) effects in urban areas, is reported here. The most common variants proposed in the literature based on a two-equation k - e{\{}open{\}} eddy viscosity model are revisited. An extensive model validation is performed on generic cases with homogeneous and non-homogeneous vegetation and compared with available experimental data. It is shown that the minimal level of the proper modeling of the non-homogeneous (i.e. with the vertically variable leaf area density) vegetation requires a model with additional four terms in the equations for the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The proposed version of the model is then applied to a computational study of flow over the Delft University of Technology site with different scenarios of the vegetation islands. By performing series of simulations, some practical guidelines are suggested to reduce intensity of the side-wind gust within the campus. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that the adopted turbulence model for non-homogeneous vegetation, in combination with the passive element approach for buildings, proved to be a physically accurate and numerically robust method. The model is recommended for future use in simulating turbulent flows in complex urban areas with vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The effect on airflow and climate of greenhouse insect screening of a 1000 m2 multi-span rose greenhouse was numerically investigated by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, which included the dynamics, thermal and water vapour transfer between the crop cover and the greenhouse air. The numerical results were at first validated against air exchange rate data using a tracer gas (N2O) technique collected in an experimental greenhouse. Using CFD facilities, these measurements were compared with simulated decay data issued from the numerical model of the greenhouse. Good agreement was found between experimental and numerical results for different wind speeds and directions. In a second stage, this numerical model was used to investigate the effects of greenhouse insect screening (anti-Bemisia) on natural ventilation and inside climate. The consequences of windward and leeward openings were studied together with the use of two insect screen types (anti-Thrips and anti-Bemisia). The main results are then discussed with respect to crop protection and climate control procedures, and it is shown that temperature and humidity rise due to insect screening can be balanced by simple arrangements of the system, such as wiser orientations of the roof vents and the use of additional side openings. ?? 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

abstract = {MAIN CONCLUSION: Quantitative neutron imaging is a promising technique to investigate leaf water flow and transpiration in real time and has perspectives towards studies of plant response to environmental conditions and plant water stress. The leaf hydraulic architecture is a key determinant of plant sap transport and plant-atmosphere exchange processes. Non-destructive imaging with neutrons shows large potential for unveiling the complex internal features of the venation network and the transport therein. However, it was only used for two-dimensional imaging without addressing flow dynamics and was still unsuccessful in accurate quantification of the amount of water. Quantitative neutron imaging was used to investigate, for the first time, the water distribution in veins and lamina, the three-dimensional venation architecture and sap flow dynamics in leaves. The latter was visualised using D2O as a contrast liquid. A high dynamic resolution was obtained by using cold neutrons and imaging relied on radiography (2D) as well as tomography (3D). The principle of the technique was shown for detached leaves, but can be applied to in vivo leaves as well. The venation network architecture and the water distribution in the veins and lamina unveiled clear differences between plant species. The leaf water content could be successfully quantified, though still included the contribution of the leaf dry matter. The flow measurements exposed the hierarchical structure of the water transport pathways, and an accurate quantification of the absolute amount of water uptake in the leaf was possible. Particular advantages of neutron imaging, as compared to X-ray imaging, were identified. Quantitative neutron imaging is a promising technique to investigate leaf water flow and transpiration in real time and has perspectives towards studies of plant response to environmental conditions and plant water stress.},

abstract = {The importance of root function in water and nutrient transport is becoming increasingly clear as constraints on agricultural resources are imposed due to water limitations and environmental concerns. Both are driven by the increasing need to expand global food production. However the historical neglect of consideration of water and nutrient uptake processes below ground has created a knowledge gap concerning the plant responses of nutrient and water limitations to crop production. The review includes sections on (i)notation and definitions of water potential, (ii)the physical coupling of plant transpiration and plant assimilation by way of the principles of diffusion of water vapor and carbon dioxide, (iii)apoplastic and symplastic water and nutrient pathways in plants, (iv)active and passive nutrient uptake, and (v)a discussion of the current state-of-the-art in multidimensional soil water flow and chemical transport modeling. The subsequent review of water uptake,nutrient uptake, and simultaneous water and nutrient uptake addresses shortcomings of current theory and modeling concepts. The review concludes with an example illustrating a possible multidimensional approach for simultaneous water and nutrient uptake modeling. Specific recommendations identify the need for coupling water and nutrient transport and uptake, including salinity effects on root water uptake and the provision of simultaneous passive and active nutrient uptake. It considers the requirement for multidimensional dedicated root water and nutrient uptake experiments to validate and calibrate hypothesized coupled root uptake models.},

abstract = {The predictive skills of single- and two-equation ( or K-epsilon) models to compute profiles of mean velocity (U), turbulent kinetic energy (K), and Reynolds stresses ((u'w') over bar) are compared against datasets collected in eight vegetation types and in a flume experiment. These datasets range in canopy height h from 0.12 to 23 m, and range in leaf area index ( LAI) from 2 to 10 m(2) m(-2). We found that for all datasets and for both closure models, measured and modelled U, K, and (u'w') over bar agree well when the mixing length (l(m)) is a priori specified. In fact, the root-mean squared error between measured and modelled U, K, and (u'w') over bar is no worse than published values for second- and third-order closure approaches. Within the context of one-dimensional modelling, there is no clear advantage to including a turbulent kinetic dissipation rate (epsilon) budget when l(m) can be specified instead. The broader implication is that the added complexity introduced by the epsilon budget in K - epsilon models need not translate into improved predictive skills of U, K, and (u'w) over bar profiles when compared to single- equation models.},

This facility represents the benchmark for the design of a larger channel for high-Reynolds-number applications. The use of an aqueous solution of sodium iodide (NaI) as the index-matching fluid is explored, with particular focus on the special design features of this model facility compared to standard water channels (corrosion-resistant components, oxygen removal, sloping test section, etc.) and previous RIM facilities. The criteria that guided the choice of the RI-matched solid-fluid combination are discussed together with facility design details and processing procedures for maintaining high quality NaI solution. A series of proof-of-concept experiments was undertaken to assess the quality of refractive index matching achievable, as well as the quality of velocity data attainable via particle image velocimetry. The facility was used to measure the flow around and through a permeable object immersed in a turbulent free-surface flow. The use of optical diagnostics for interrogation of the flow behavior in this configuration is normally not possible due to optical access restrictions but for which RIM produces excellent results.},

Transpiration rate and leaf temperature are the result of the interaction of several simul? taneous environmental factors interacting with a leaf to a degree deter? mined by several plant properties. Hence the dependent variables, transpira? tion rate and leaf temperature, depend upon many independent variables of climate and plant acting in various combinations at any single moment. The investigator either has not recognized this inherent difficulty, or complexity, or if he did recognize it, did not know what to do about it. Therefore many experiments which were thought to be definitive were indefinite because one or more variables were ignored in the context of the variables observed. Very often good quantitative measurements were made of transpiration rate, leaf temperature, air temperature, wind, and relative humidity and then the relationships between dependent and independent variables were not made quantitative for lack of a good analytical framework. In other words, to put it simply and bluntly, the science of transpiration and leaf temperature was not understood. It is hoped that this presentation will be a step toward increased understanding of the interaction between transpira? tion, leaf temperatures, and environment.},

The proposed direct approach of constructing thermal models overcomes the shortcomings of existing models and retains one of the most important advantages of the LB methods, the exact space discretization of the advection step, thus paving the way for direct numerical simulation of thermal flows. New thermal wall boundary condition capable of handling curved geometries immersed in a multispeed lattice is proposed by extending the Tamm-Mott-Smith boundary condition. Entropic realization of the current model ensures stability of the model also for subgrid simulations.

abstract = {The solution to the 2-D time-dependent unsaturated flow equation is numerically approximated by a second-order accurate cell-centered finite-volume discretization on unstructured grids. The approximation method is based on a vertex-centered Least Squares linear reconstruction of the solution gradients at mesh edges. A Taylor series development in time of the water content dependent variable in a finite-difference framework guarantees that the proposed finite volume method is mass conservative. A Picard iterative scheme solves at each time step the resulting non-linear algebraic problem. The performance of the method is assessed on five different test cases and implementing four distinct soil constitutive relationships. The first test case deals with a column infiltration problem. It shows the capability of providing a mass-conservative behavior. The second test case verifies the numerical approximation by comparison with an analytical mixed saturated-unsaturated solution. In this case, the water drains from a fully saturated portion of a 1-D column. The third and fourth test cases illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme on sharp soil heterogeneities on 1-D and 2-D multi-layered infiltration problems. The 2-D case shows the passage of an abrupt infiltration front across a curved interface between two layers. Finally, the fifth test case compares the numerical results with an analytical solution that is developed for a 2-D heterogeneous soil with a source term representing plant roots. This last test case illustrates the formal second-order accuracy of the method in the numerical approximation of the pressure head. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The field measurements were made in small blocks of Sitka spruce respaced 15 years previously to different stand densities. The wind tunnel measurements were made with dynamically correct 20-cm tall plastic trees. The maximum bending moment on trees showed a linear increase with the ratio of spacing to height. Estimates suggest that at the wider spacing tree diameter has increased sufficiently so that trees are less likely to break. However, the increase in resistance to overturning is not as rapid as the increase in wind loading and wider spaced trees will be more vulnerable to overturning. Wind tunnel measurements were also carried out on a range of commercial thinning practices and showed that the critical factor in reducing stand stability is the size of gap made in the forest. The mechanical and dynamic characteristics of trees at different spacing are presented. These show that with increasing spacing the Young's modulus of trees decreases and their damping coefficient increases. This illustrates that wide spaced trees have weaker wood than close spaced trees but they are less reliant on the support of neighbouring trees. The implications of the measurements on the overall stability of stands and the implications for forest managers are discussed.},

abstract = {A lake evaporation study was conducted on a small water-supply reservoir (8.8 km2) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, during 30 months. Air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, sunshine duration and solar radiation were measured continuously, together with monthly water temperature profiles. This allowed the calculation of evaporation by the energybudget Bowen ratio (EBBR) method, as well as evaporation estimates using a climatological model, the Complementary Relationship Lake Evaporation (CRLE), which is widely used by electricity companies in Brazil. The CRLE is probably the most complete model available for lake evaporation that requires only monthly means of air temperature, air humidity and sunshine duration (or solar radiation), and provides estimates not only of monthly evaporation but of the rate of change of stored enthalpy in the lake's waters and equilibrium temperature, a surrogate of the actual water surface temperature. Since all of the model's variables are amenable to physical interpretation, it is possible to relate them to the actually measured values. We have found that the Priestley-Taylor equation, which is the basis of CRLE's evaporation estimates, performs very well under conditions of positive (upward) sensible heat flux. The model's equilibrium temperature underestimates the actual water surface temperature but follows the same seasonal pattern. The model's estimates of the rate of change of stored enthalpy are generally poor, making the CRLE generate evaporation values that are delayed and damped in comparison with the EBBR method. The CRLE tends to overestimate evaporation slightly (8{\%}) over the 30-month period.},

These interactions range from leaf flutter to uprooting and seed dispersal, as well as indirect effects on photosynthesis or insect communication. I first estimate the relevant nondimensional parameters and then discuss turbulence, plant dynamics, and the mechanisms of interaction in this context. Some common features are identified and analyzed in relation to the wind engineering of manmade structures. Strong coupling between plants and wind exists, in which the plant motion modifies the wind dynamics.

The imaging technique monitors the attenuation of a thermal neutron beam as it traverses a flow field and provides measurements every 30 ms with an image area {\textgreater}410 cm2 and a spatial resolution ???0.05 cm. The technique is illustrated by measuring the variation in moisture content across a wetting front moving at constant velocity through SiO2 sand. The relative contributions of the hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity terms in Richards' equation to the total fluid flux within the wetting front region were also measured. The diffusivity was found to rise from zero to a peak value within the wetting front region before falling off while the conductivity was found to rise monotonically. The reliability of the technique was checked via mass balance. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is probably due to the additional source (and/or sink) terms, whose parameterization remained uncertain. This model must include source terms for both turbulent kinetic energy (k) and the viscous dissipation rate ({\$}\epsilon{\$}), to account for vegetation wake turbulence budget. In this note, we show how Kolmogorov's relation allows for an analytical solution to be calculated within the portion of a dense and homogeneous canopy where the mixing length does not vary. By substitution within model equations, this solution allows for a set of constraints on source term model coefficients to be derived.Those constraints should meet both Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes equationsand large-eddy simulation sub-grid scale turbulence modelling requirements.Although originating from within a limited portion of the canopy, the predictedcoefficients values must be valid elsewhere in order to make the model capable of predicting the whole canopy-layer flow with a single set of constants.},

However, quantitative researches about the impact of different vegetation species on the outdoor thermal environment are still scarce and the actual engineering problem that what's the best choice, grass, shrub or trees cannot be responded. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional model which can accurately predict the effect of green on thermal environment and guide the green design is urgently needed. Thus, a finite volume method with unstructured mesh is used to simulate the impact of vegetation on the outdoor thermal environment for three common vegetation species, namely: trees, shrub and lawn. Special attention is paid on the variation of air temperature at 1.5m, surface temperature, PET, WBGT, wind speed and pressure with these species. The study could be described as follows: A simulation method including the model of three-dimensional vegetation is developed for predicting and evaluating the outdoor thermal environment and its accuracy is confirmed by comparing simulation results and field measured data; For different evaluation standards and areas, the sequence of the improvement of different species on outdoor thermal environment is quite different: For air temperature at 1.5m and thermal comfort and safety (PET and WBGT), the sequence is trees{\textgreater}lawn{\textgreater}shrubs, but for surface temperature, the sequence is lawn{\textgreater}shrubs{\textgreater}trees; For these areas located in the downstream of planting area, trees and shrub can reduce the wind speed and decrease the pressure of the building. But for these areas located in the downstream of without planting area, they can increase the wind speed and the pressure; Suggestions are provided to guide the arrangement of these species in planning stage to achieve the purpose of optimizing outdoor thermal environment in summer and outdoor wind environment in winter.},

An established urban energy balance model was modified to quantify the cooling potential of green roofs and study the scalability of this mitigation strategy. Simulations were performed for different climates and urban geometries, with varying soil moisture content, green roof fraction and urban surface layer thickness. All simulations show a linear relationship between surface layer temperature reduction $\delta$T s and domain averaged evaporation rates from vegetation mmW, i.e. $\delta$T s = e W mmW, where e W is the evaporative cooling potential with a value of ∼-0.35 Kdaymm-1. This relationship is independent of the method by which water is supplied. We also derive a simple algebraic relation for e W using a Taylor series expansion.},

abstract = {Flow field and concentration measurements have been performed in an idealized model of an urban street canyon with one row of trees arranged along the center axis. The model was set up in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel and the approach flow was directed perpendicular to the street axis. A line source embedded in the bottom of the street was used to release tracer gas for the simulation of traffic exhaust emissions. Trees with spherical crowns were modeled and positioned inside the street canyon, varying crown diameter, crown permeability, trunk height and tree spacing. Traffic-induced turbulence was simulated by rotating belts with thin plates. Concentrations were measured at the facades of the street canyon. For small tree crowns, only little changes in concentration were measured, however, increasing crown diameters led to increasing concentrations at the leeward street canyon wall associated with a reduction of local concentrations at the windward wall. For some cases, a variation of trunk height led to a modification of the concentration pattern on the walls. Increasing the tree spacing resulted in a noticeable concentration decrease. When compared to the situation with standing (but emitting) traffic, the traffic-induced turbulence by two-way car movements always contributed to a more homogenous concentration field inside the street canyon yielding to reduced mean concentration levels. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For decades thermal infrared satellite imagery has been used for climate studies of a variety of geosystems, including urban areas. Additionally, airborne thermal remotely sensed data can provide high resolution information about urban land surface temperatures (LST). Numerous studies make use of these data for the investigation of urban-rural LST differences, commonly known as the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. Most of these studies try to analyse the urban heat island by means of the LST distribution. It seems that the UHI is easy to measure, easy to explain, easy to find, and easy to illustrate. Due to this apparent simplicity some people seem to jump into UHI studies without fully understanding the nature of the phenomenon as far as time and spatial scales, physical processes and the numerous methodological pitfalls inherent to UHI studies are concerned. In this study the use of thermal infrared satellite data with respect to the assessment of the surface UHI is investigated. The need to clearly distinguish between different types of UHI is emphasised by recalling the (surface) temperature and the UHI terminology. The pretended simplicity of UHI effects is in reality a result of complex interactions between local radiation conditions, earth surface heat budget, the urban structure and the boundary layer atmosphere. Different methods may provide completely different results. This paper aims to bring more clearness into the subject by assessing the urban heat island of the city of Basel, Switzerland, by the use of thermal data provided by satellites (Landsat TM/ETM+), helicopter-borne infrared camera (InfraTec VarioCAM{\textregistered}) and ground-based measurements of air temperature profiles. It is shown that UHIs vary essentially with the choice of the respective temperature (LST, air temperature) and height (surface level, street/canopy level, roof level).},

The experiments are conducted at different streamwise locations covering the entire flow fields around the rotor, the stator, the gap between them, and the wakes behind. Vector maps of the instantaneous and phase-averaged flow fields as well as the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy are obtained.

Based on a benchmark test case benefiting from wind tunnel measurements (CODASC), this study qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the prediction of traffic-induced pollutant concentration with respect to several reference studies. It also analyses the physics of the flow and concentration fields. Although the problem might seem rather simple, the flow is highlighted to be strongly three dimensional and transient. These properties enhance pollutant dispersion in the empty street canyon but air flow velocity and turbulence intensity tend to decrease in tree crowns. This effect of trees increases both mean and peak concentration levels at pedestrian level, which may be problematic in cities with dense traffic. These results show that LBM-LES is particularly well suited to study dispersion problems towards the development of more breathable cities.},

abstract = {A novel approach for PIV image pre-processing is proposed to deal with the undesired effect of laser light reflections from solid walls in wind tunnel experiments. The method can be applied for both stationary interfaces as well as when the image of the interface is moving due to vibration of either the model or the imaging system. The working hypothesis is that the motion of the interface is resolved temporally, which is typically the case when employing high-speed PIV systems. The method is based on the decomposition of the pixel intensity in the frequency domain. The high-frequency content of the signal is due to the transit of seeding particles, whereas undesired reflections will appear in the low-frequency range. Applying a high-pass filter on the light intensity time history retains only the contribution of the seeding particles and rejects the undesired light reflections. Two experiments show the application of the method. In the low-speed flow regime around a pitching airfoil, the trace of the laser impinging on the moving surface can be mostly eliminated, enabling cross correlation analysis of the flow closer to the wall. In the transonic regime, experiments are performed in an industrial wind tunnel around the base region of the ARIANE V launcher model. Here, the high-pass filter eliminates all secondary reflections and enhances the particles peak intensity relative to the reflections and the background light},

These three submodels were integrated into the present model, which we applied to a single model tree to investigate how environmental factors affected the budgets of heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide within a tree. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {- Combined model of heat budget (based on Ross's radiation transfer model), water vapor and CO2 (based on stomatal conductance model by Collatz et al.)

- Single tree model

- investigate environmental factors

- used turbulence closure model (epsilon equation) to determine 3D flow field.

- turbulence model includes drag bodies (leaves)

Conclusions:
- low air temp, high humidity, low CO2 widely spread across rear of tree
- transpiration, photosythesis strong in front and top of tree with direct solar radiation
- a lot of short-wave radiation absorbed by leaves and released with transpiration
- long-wave radiation not negligible in energy balance
- sensible heat transfer of water vapor flux from leaves is negligible in energy eq. turbulence model for dry almost same as moist air.
- heat exchange due to O2 and CO2 due to photosynthesis is negligible in heat balance.},

abstract = {Many plants are known to preferentially allocate root growth to soil patches with elevated availability of growth-limiting nutrients. Little is known about how this influences the uptake of other nutrients such as trace metals. Here we investigated zinc (Zn) uptake by different crop plants in soil with heterogeneous phosphorus (P) and Zn distribution. Triticum aestivum L. (spring wheat), Cucumis sativus L. (cucumber) and Lupin albus L. (white lupin) were grown in rhizoboxes on low-P soil treated with local P and Zn amendments. A treatment with homogeneous P amendment was used as control. Root system development was monitored over 55 days using neutron radiography and Winrhizo. The treatments had no effect on total root and shoot biomass, but root growth responded positively to local soil P enrichment but not to local Zn enrichment in all three plants. Wheat and cucumber responded with preferential allocation of root length, while in white lupin cluster root (CR) allocation was shifted to the P-enriched soil patches. Shoot Zn uptake was increased in wheat and cucumber when Zn- and P-enrichment were co-located and decreased when they were disjunct, indicating that shoot Zn uptake was related to root length growth in these two plants. In contrast, preferential CR allocation in lupin was not associated with a treatment effect on shoot Zn uptake.},

abstract = {We review some of the main methods of solving the image matching problem in Particle-Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). This is a technique of Experimental Fluid Dynamics for determining the velocity fields of moving fluids. This problem is a two-dimensional random-points matching problem that condtitutes a prototypal problem, analogous to the one-dimensional matching problem for Julesz [1] random-dot stereograms. Our study deals with a particular method of solution, namely the neural network algorithm proposed by Labont{\'{e}} [2,3]. Our interest in this neural network comes from the fact that it has been shown to outperform the best matching methods in PTV, and the belief that it is actually a method applicable to many other instances of the correspondence problem. We obtain many new results concerning the nature of this algorithm, the main one of which consists in showing how this neural network functions as an enhancer for nearest-neighbour particle image matching. We calculate its complexity, and produce two different types of learning curves for it. We exhibit the fact that the RMS error of the neural network decreases at least exponentially with the number of cycles of the neural network. The neural network constructs a Self-Organised Map (SOM), which corresponds to distorting back the two photos until they merge into a single photo. We explain how this distortion is driven, under the network dynamics, by the few good nearest-neighbours (sometimes as few as 20{\%}) that exist initially. These are able to pull with them the neighboring images, toward their matching partners. We report the results of measuremnts that corroborate our analysis of this process.},

abstract = {The current work evaluates the impact of urban trees over the dispersion of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted by road traffic, due to the induced modification of the wind flow characteristics. With this purpose, the standard flow equations with a k$\epsilon$ closure for turbulence were extended with the capability to account for the aerodynamic effect of trees over the wind field. Two CFD models were used for testing this numerical approach. Air quality simulations were conducted for two periods of 31. h in selected areas of Lisbon and Aveiro, in Portugal, for distinct relative wind directions: approximately 45° and nearly parallel to the main avenue, respectively. The statistical evaluation of modelling performance and uncertainty revealed a significant improvement of results with trees, as shown by the reduction of the NMSE from 0.14 to 0.10 in Lisbon, and from 0.14 to 0.04 in Aveiro, which is independent from the CFD model applied. The consideration of the plant canopy allowed to fulfil the data quality objectives for ambient air quality modelling established by the Directive 2008/50/EC, with an important decrease of the maximum deviation between site measurements and CFD results. In the non-aligned wind situation an average 12{\%} increase of the CO concentrations in the domain was observed as a response to the aerodynamic action of trees over the vertical exchange rates of polluted air with the above roof-level atmosphere; while for the aligned configuration an average 16{\%} decrease was registered due to the enhanced ventilation of the street canyon. These results show that urban air quality can be optimised based on knowledge-based planning of green spaces. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient CO{\textless}latex{\textgreater}{\$}{\_}2{\$}{\textless}/latex{\textgreater} concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.},

abstract = {Greenhouse crops exert a drag force causing a net loss of momentum in the airflow and a negative effect on ventilation. The drag effect produced by the airflow through crops can be modelled as a function of leaf area density (LAD) and the square of air velocity. A wind tunnel was used to determine the drag coefficient CDof four horticultural crops. Three samples with differing values of LAD were tested for each crop. The values of CDobtained for tomato, sweet pepper, aubergine and bean were 0{\textperiodcentered}26, 0{\textperiodcentered}23, 0{\textperiodcentered}23 and 0{\textperiodcentered}22, respectively. Coefficients obtained for the four crops were similar, which suggests that the effect of leaf shape and size is not significant. The drag coefficients found decreased with velocity and remained nearly constant for Reynolds number greater than 6×104. The drag coefficient allows the aerodynamic behaviour of crops to be characterised, although the use of a constant value involves a significant error (15-30{\%}) for velocities usually registered inside greenhouses (0{\textperiodcentered}1-0{\textperiodcentered}5 m s-1). Maximum values of CDwere obtained for velocities between 0{\textperiodcentered}5 and 1{\textperiodcentered}5 m s-1due to the effects of change in leaf position and variation in airflow regime. {\textcopyright} 2006 Silsoe Research Institute.},

abstract = {Water is a key limiting factor for vegetation restoration in the semi-arid areas of China. Caragana korshinkii Kom is a shrub that is widely planted in this region to control soil erosion and land desertification. The objective of this study was to investigate the fine root distribution of mature C. korshinkii and its water consumption, when grown in either silt loam or sandy soils, in order to understand differences between the water cycles of two such soils found in the transition zone between fertile loess hills and desert of the Northern Loess Plateau. Fine root distributions were measured using the trench-profile method. Soil water dynamics were monitored with a neutron probe during two growing seasons. The results showed that fine root area density (FRAD) declined with increasing soil depth in both soils, with 70.7{\%} and 96.6{\%} of the total fine roots being concentrated in the upper 1-m layer of the silt loam and sandy soils, respectively. Water consumption by C. korshinkii in the silt loam was close to that in the sandy soil. Most water consumption in both soil types was from the upper 1-m layer. Little variation in plant available water ( PAW) occurred in the 3-6 m soil layer during the whole study period. However, in this layer, the PAW was significantly lower in the silt loam soil than in the sandy soil. Total actual evapotranspiration (ET(a)) was slightly higher from the sandy soil plots than from those of the silt loam soil during both growing seasons. Our study indicated that mature C. korshinkii effectively uses about the same amount of water from either the silt loam or sandy soils, but that more soil water at depth was extracted from silt loam soil than from sandy soil.},

abstract = {This paper describes a climatic analysis of landscape strategies for outdoor cooling in a hot-arid region, considering the efficiency of water use. Six landscape strategies were studied, using different combinations of trees, lawn, and an overhead shade mesh. The effects of these treatments were tested during the summer season in two semi-enclosed courtyards located at an urban settlement in the arid Negev Highlands of southern Israel. Compared to a non-vegetated exposed courtyard, which on average reached a maximum air temperature of 34 °C in mid-afternoon, a similar courtyard treated with shade trees and grass yielded a daytime temperature depression of up to 2.5 K, while shading the courtyard with a fabric shading mesh, counter-intuitively, caused a relative increase of nearly 1 K. Unshaded grass was found to cause only a small air temperature depression and had the highest water requirement. However when the grass was shaded, either by the trees or by the shade mesh, a synergic effect produced greater cooling as well as a reduction of more than 50{\%} in total water use. The "cooling efficiency" of these strategies was calculated as the ratio between the sensible heat removed from the space and the latent heat of evaporation, with the latter representing the amount of water required for landscape irrigation. This measure is proposed as a criterion for evaluating landscape strategies in arid regions, where water resources are scarce. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.A single-layer urban canopy model that captures sub-facet heterogeneity and various hydrological processes is further developed to explicitly incorporate trees within the urban canyon. The physical processes associated with trees are shortwave/longwave radiation exchange, including mutual interception and shading by trees and buildings and multiple reflections, sensible heat and latent heat (through transpiration) exchange, and root water uptake. A computationally-efficient geometric approach is applied to the radiation exchanges, requiring a priori knowledge of view factors. These view factors are first obtained from independent Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations, and subsequently simple relations, which are functions of canyon aspect ratio and tree-crown ratio, are proposed to estimate them. The developed model is evaluated against field observations at two urban sites and one suburban site, showing improved performance for latent heat flux compared to the previous version that only includes ground vegetation. The trees in the urban canopy act to considerably decrease sensible heat flux and increase latent heat flux, and these effects are found to be more significant in the more dense urban site. Sensitivity tests are then performed to examine the effects of tree geometry relative to canyon geometry. The results indicate that the tree-crown size relative to canyon width is the most influential parameter to decrease sensible heat flux and increase latent heat flux, resulting in cooling of the urban area.},

abstract = {We introduce a multilayer model to estimate mean radiant temperature (MRT) and evaluate the pedestrian thermal comfort in a street canyon. This multilayer MRT model (MMRT) is suitable for urban streets with varying building and tree heights. The model simulates shortwave and longwave radiation exchange for each urban element and area-weighted view factors, then finally obtains MRT of pedestrians on the sidewalk. Probability density profiles of buildings and trees enable the consideration of urban vertical heterogeneity. Furthermore, Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) allows the model to evaluate the radiation transfer in complex urban areas. We verify the effectiveness of MCRT and the probabilistic density profile approach. A sensitivity test conducted in Seoul on September 1, 2017 using the MMRT reveals that MRT can be reduced by 23 °C as the tree leaf area density increases from 0 to 1, and by 18 °C as the tree height increases from 0 m to 12 m in 1300 LST. The model controls urban form and pavement parameters as well as tree parameters. We aim to use this model to compare diverse MRT mitigation strategies and confirm the best strategy for thermal-friendly street design.},

Matching the refractive indices of the working fluid and the test section walls and interfaces provides an effective solution to this problem. The experimental set-ups designed to be used along with laser imaging techniques are typically constructed of transparent solid materials. In this investigation, different types of aqueous salt solutions and various organic fluids are studied for refractive index matching with acrylic and fused quartz, which are commonly used in construction of the test sections. One aqueous CaCl2 2H2O solution (63 {\%} by weight) and two organic fluids, Dibutyl Phthalate and P-Cymene, are suggested for refractive index matching with fused quartz and acrylic, respectively. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the refractive indices of these fluids is investigated, and the Thermooptic Constant is calculated for each fluid. Finally, the fluid viscosity for different shear rates is measured as a function of temperature and is applied to characterize the physical behavior of the proposed fluids. 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Malys2014,
abstract = {Covering a building envelope with vegetation provides a solution capable of mitigating the urban heat island phenomenon and its impact on the energy consumption of buildings. Simulation tools to assess the efficiency of such a solution are lacking, especially for green walls. The present research aims to offer a hydrothermal model of green walls and green roofs for implementation in the urban microclimate simulation software SOLENE-Microclimate. To this end, a fast, efficient coupled heat-mass transfer model has been developed. Simulation results are compared with experimental data obtained from the LEEA Laboratory in Geneva for three green wall samples. Aside from the level of uncertainty found for the evapotranspiration calculation, these results confirm that the model accurately characterizes the temperature evolution of all three prototypes. Results also show good correlation between measured and simulated temperatures. The model is indeed able to reproduce water stress and characterize various types of living walls. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Boulard1999,
abstract = {Convective transfers determine, for a large part, the energy and mass balances which regulate the micro-climate inside a greenhouse. Airflows and temperature patterns induced by buoyancy forces through greenhouse roof openings were considered. Flow visualizations were performed on a half-scale test cell simulating the absorption of solar radiation at the floor surface of a single-span greenhouse. Steady regime temperatures and flow patterns were investigated for a single-sided roof vent and for two symmetrical roof vents. In all cases, it was observed that incoming air streams through the lower section of the openings swept over the greenhouse walls in a large convective loop before escaping through the upper sections of the openings. These natural convective patterns were numerically simulated by means of computational fluid dynamics. For both configurations, it was found that the shape of the convective loop and the mean components of the air velocity and temperature were generally in good agreement with the experimental results. A detailed comparison of the measured and computed scalar fields through an opening section could also be performed. Finally, it is suggested that these results could provide useful hints to improve the greenhouse and vent designs. {\textcopyright} 1999 Silsoe Research Institute.},

@article{Tuzet2003,
abstract = {A model that couples stomatal conductance, photosynthe- sis, leaf energy balance and transport of water through the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum is presented. Stomatal conductance in the model depends on light, temperature and intercellular CO2 concentration via photosynthesis and on leaf water potential, which in turn is a function of soil water potential, the rate of water flow through the soil and plant, and on xylem hydraulic resistance. Water transport from soil to roots is simulated through solution of Richards' equation. The model captures the observed hysteresis in diurnal variations in stomatal conductance, assimilation rate and transpiration for plant canopies. Hysteresis arises because atmospheric demand for water from the leaves typically peaks in mid-afternoon and because of uneven distribution of soil matric potentials with distance from the roots. Potentials at the root surfaces are lower than in the bulk soil, and once soil water supply starts to limit transpi- ration, root potentials are substantially less negative in the morning than in the afternoon. This leads to higher sto- matal conductances, CO2 assimilation and transpiration in the morning compared to later in the day. Stomatal conduc- tance is sensitive to soil and plant hydraulic properties and to root length density only after approximately 10 d of soil drying, when supply of water by the soil to the roots becomes limiting. High atmospheric demand causes tran- spiration rates, LE, to decline at a slightly higher soil water content, of LE versus s, than at low atmospheric demand, but all curves s fall on the same line when soil water supply limits transpiration. Stomatal conductance cannot be mod- elled in isolation, but must be fully coupled with models of photosynthesis/respiration and the transport of water from soil, through roots, stems and leaves to the atmosphere.

@article{Allegrini2012a,
abstract = {For computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of large urban areas the air flow near surfaces is normally modelled using Wall Functions (WFs). This study aims at improving the accuracy of WFs, in terms of heat transfer predictions. Turbulent boundary layers at heated building surfaces in a street canyon were analysed with low-Reynolds number modelling (LRNM). Buoyancy was accounted for, due to its importance in street canyons e.g. by solar radiation. Two extreme types of normalized temperature profiles could be identified in the thermal boundary layer dependent on the Richardson (Ri) number. One extreme at low Ri number could be attributed to forced convective flow, which is adequately described by existing standard wall functions (SWFs), and the second extreme at Ri{\textgreater}1 to mixed convective flows, where WFs adapted for non-equilibrium flows (NEWFs) are appropriate. Based on these two extremes, an adaptive temperature wall function (AWF) was derived that varies between the two existing WFs dependent on the local Ri. This AWF can account for the co-occurrence of forced and mixed convective flow regimes at a single surface. CFD simulations of street canyon configurations with SWF showed errors in the wall heat fluxes up to 60{\%}, compared to the LRNM results, and up to 30{\%} for NEWFs. With the proposed AWF, these errors were reduced to less than 10{\%} for the majority of the cases studied over the whole range of Ri numbers. We conclude that the proposed AWF allows for more accurate convective heat transfer analysis in urban CFD studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
