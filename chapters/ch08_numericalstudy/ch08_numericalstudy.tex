\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, the fully coupled (integrated) numerical model, described in \cref{ch:numericalmethod}, is used to assess the impact of vegetation on urban microclimate. To accurately assess the impact of vegetation on urban microclimate, we must determine: i) the influence of vegetation on the turbulent airflow, ii) the influence of plant transpiration on hygrothermal conditions, iii) the influence of plant shading on the urban environment, and iv), the net influence of all the parameters on the pedestrian thermal comfort. In this chapter, the influence of vegetation is assessed using two different numerical setups: a) the study on the influence of vegetation on microclimate of an urban street canyon, and b) a case study on the influence of vegetation in a realistic city topology in Z\"urich, Switzerland at a location known as Muensterhof (in german: M\"unsterhof). The Muensterhof is a town square within the city of Zurich that currently lacks vegetation. The objective of the study in the urban street canyon is to perform a parametric study and determine the parameters that play a main role in improving thermal comfort.  Furthermore, the influence of soil moisture change on the plant transpiration and the leaf energy balance is investigated. The objective of the case study in Muensterhof is to determine the microclimate modification of vegetation in a realistic setting.

\section{Urban street canyon}

A numerical assessment of the impact of vegetation is first performed in a urban street-canyon. The study investigates the influence of transpirative and shaded cooling due to vegetation on the pedestrian comfort inside a street canyon. In this study, we investigate the cooling potential of vegetation, such as a row of trees, on the microclimate of a street canyon using the developed CFD model in OpenFOAM. The cooling effect of isolated vegetation was studied in \cref{ch:parametricstudy}. In this chapter, we investigate the influence of vegetation in a setup described in \cite{Kubilay2018}, who investigated the influence of only the building and street materials on the microclimate. In this study,  we investigate how the vegetation modifies the microclimate. The vegetation integrated numerical model is described in \cref{ch:numericalmethod} where the plant transpiration is dependent on the available soil moisture. Furthermore, vegetation modifies the street-canyon radiation balance as described in \cref{sec:radiationmodel}, where the vegetation intercepts the direct solar radiation and provides shading to the urban surfaces. The reflected (assumed to be diffused) short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation is modeled using surface-to-surface radiation model (i.e.,  \textit{radiosity} approach or also known as ``view factor'' model) as described in \cref{sec:radiationmodel}. The goal of the advanced radiation model, in contrast, to approach described in \cref{ch:parametricstudy}, is to provide a more accurate estimation of the mean radiant temperature $T_{\textit{mrt}}$, a key variable for an accurate prediction of thermal comfort index. In this study, the thermal comfort for pedestrians is evaluated using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The study aims to understand better the governing phenomena related to vegetation that plays a key role in improving pedestrian thermal comfort. Therefore, the study simulates multiple cases to isolate the influence of transpirative cooling and cooling due to shading by trees. Thus, we aim to understand the main contribution of natural cooling of vegetation on urban microclimate.  

\subsection{Simulation setup}

The simulations are performed for a street canyon with a vegetation zone of $2 \times 10 \times 4$ m$^3$, representing a row of trees which are surrounded by two buildings of $10 \times 50 \times 10$ m$^3$ ($x\times y \times z$), as shown in \cref{fig:domain_new5}. The numerical domain size is $230\times 250 \times 60$ m$^3$  ($x\times y \times z$), where the inlet, outlet, top, and side walls are positioned $5 H$, $5 H$, $15 H$, and $10 H$ away, respectively, based on CFD best practices \citep{Blocken2015, Franke2007, Tominaga2008}. The numerical domain is discretized into $\num{1178080}$ hexahedral cells with minimum cell size of $\num{1e-3}$ m$^{3}$ near the building walls (see \cref{fig:mesh_resolution}) and are determined following a grid-refinement study. The vegetation zone has a foliage height of $4$ m (with $z_{\textit{min}}= 4$ m), leaf area density $a= 1$ m$^2$\,m$^{-3}$, leaf drag coefficient $c_d=0.2$ and leaf size $l=0.1$ m. The buildings are oriented perpendicular to the wind direction. The meteorological data are based on a typical meteorological year and the total solar radiation intensity is for a clear sky on the 21$^{\mathrm{st}}$ of June in the city of Zurich, Switzerland used in the study of \cite{Kubilay2018}. \highlight{However, in future, extreme weather events such as heat wave should also be investigated to determine how vegetation can ensure cities are resilient to the climate of the future. It has been predicted that global warming and climate change will increase the frequency of such extreme events \citep{Mitchell2016}.} The wind speed at the building height is $U_{\textit{ref}}=5$ m\,s$^{-1}$ \highlight{(assumed constant during the day for simplicity)} where turbulence kinetic energy $k$ and turbulence dissipation rate $\varepsilon$ are determined using \cref{eq:ableq} \citep{Richards1993} with $u_*/U = 0.072$ and $z_0 = 0.03$ m. Standard wall functions are employed for the wall boundary and a constant static pressure of $p=0$ Pa at the outlet boundary. The inlet, top and side wall are prescribed with the ambient temperature varies between $11$ $^{\circ}C$ and $19$ $^{\circ}C$ with solar noon at 13:28 and the relative humidity varies between $62\%$ and $86\%$ $RH$ as shown in \cref{fig:meteobc}. The ambient CO$_2$ concentration is taken to be $c=380$ $\mu$mol\,mol$^{-1}$ \highlight{(assumed constant during the day for simplicity)}.

The coupling of air domain, the solid domains (including soil region), with the vegetation is discussed in \cref{sec:couplingalgorithm}. \cref{fig:soliddomain} shows the setup of the solid domain used in the study. The figure depicts the configuration of two buildings forming a street-canyon with a vegetation zone in the middle. The cross-section is a $x-z$ plane at $y=125$ m  (i.e., $y$-center of the street-canyon). The two buildings have size $10 \times 50 \times 10$ m$^3$ ($x\times y \times z$) each with a brick layer of $0.09$ m inside the street-canyon and a soil region at the street where the vegetation roots is present. The soil is composed of equal composition of sand, silt, and clay with a uniform root area density $r = 5$ m$^{2}$\,m$^{-3}$ of the size of $4 \times 14 \times 1$ m$^{3}$ directly below the foliage region, spanning $\mvec{x}_{\textit{min}} = (62, -1, 118)$ and $\mvec{x}_{\textit{max}} = (68, 0, 132)$. The temperature inside the building $T_{\textit{in}}$, thermal resistance $R$ of wall and roof, the density $\rho_0$, thermal conductivity $\lambda$, emissivity $\epsilon$ and albedo $\alpha$ of the various solid regions are also indicated in \cref{fig:soliddomain}. The vegetation parameters used in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) vegetation model are given in \cref{tab:spacconditions}. The vegetation properties are based of Loblolly pine (\textit{Pinus taeda}) \citep{Manoli2014,Volpe2013,Launiainen2015,Manzoni2011,Vogel2016}. \highlight{Although not common in cities, this species was used due to availability of vegetation properties.} In future, this numerical modeling approach should enables to study various other species that are more common in cities.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

The influence of vegetation in an urban street canyon is determined by separately studying the influence of shading and the plant transpiration. The influence of these two parameters on the microclimate inside the street-canyon is studied by determining the influence on air temperature, mean radiation temperature, short-wave radiation intensity, and finally UTCI distribution. 

\subsubsection*{Influence of plant transpiration and shading}

\cref{fig:USC_T} shows the direct short-wave radiation intensity $|q_{\textit{s,dir}}|$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) inside the street-canyon (i.e., $x-z$ plane at $y=125$ m) where the vegetation zone is indicated by a green box. Nine subplot at shown of different times of the days from 03:00 to 23:00 (HH:MM) with 150 minutes interval. The figure shows the contribution of the vegetation to the solar radiation intensity inside the street-canyon. We see that vegetation intercepts the solar radiation during the day providing shading to the nearby urban surfaces. The vegetation acts as a radiation sink especially when the solar radiation is high during noon. It is important as the urban materials with high thermal capacity contribute to the urban heat island by absorbing the solar radiation. By providing shading to the urban environment, vegetation can, therefore, reduce the urban heat island effect.

	\label{fig:USC_Tmrt}
\end{sidewaysfigure}


\cref{fig:USC_Tmrt} shows the mean radiant temperature $T_{\textit{mrt}}$  ($^{\circ}$C) inside the street-canyon throughout the day that a person would experience. \highlight{Although $T_{\textit{mrt}}$ is a surface related value, in this study we determine $T_{\textit{mrt}}$ everywhere in the street-canyon to determine how UTCI felt by a person is varying inside. } The mean radiant temperature is determined as follows: 
\begin{equation}
T_{\textit{mrt}} = \left( T_{\textit{umrt}}^4  + \frac{f_p a_b}{\epsilon_p \sigma} q_{\textit{s,dir}} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}
\label{eq:Tmrt2}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\textit{umrt}}$ is the mean radiant temperature component belonging to the diffused or reflected part (i.e., from terrestrial source), $f_p$ is projected surface area of the person exposed to the sun, $\alpha_p$ is the albedo, $\epsilon_p$ is the emission coefficient and $q_{\textit{s,dir}}$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) is the direct solar radiation. The diffused/reflected component of the MRT is defined as:
\begin{equation}
T_{\textit{umrt}} = \left[ \frac{1}{\sigma} \sum_{i}^N \left(q_{\textit{r,i}} + \frac{a_b}{\epsilon_p} q_{\textit{s,i}} \right)F_i\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}
\label{eq:Tumrt2}
\end{equation}
where $q_{\textit{r,i}}$ (W\,m$^{-2}$)  is the long-wave radiation emitted from surface $i$, $q_{\textit{s,i}}$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) is the reflected (assumed to be diffused) short-wave radiation from surface $i$, and $F_i$ is the view-factor between surface $i$ and the person. Thus, the mean radiant temperature $T_{\textit{mrt}}$ is directly dependent on the long-wave and the short-wave radiation fluxes in the street-canyon, including the contribution from the direct solar radiation $q_{\textit{r,dir}}$. \cref{fig:USC_Tmrt} is seen to be directly correlated with the short-wave radiation plots depicted in \cref{fig:USC_qrdir}. At regions of high direct solar radiation, the mean radiant temperature approaches $T_{\textit{mrt}}\rightarrow50$ ($^{\circ}$C). In the shaded regions, there is an $18$  ($^{\circ}$C) difference in the mean radiant temperature. This indicates that solar radiation plays a crucial role in the mean radiant temperature and thereby the thermal comfort (investigated in detail in the next section). Furthermore, we see that at pedestrian level (i.e., $z=2$ m) the mean radiant temperature is at highest. This is related to the emitted (or reflected) radiation from urban surfaces. At the height of $2$ m, the location is exposed to (or ``views'') more urban surfaces emitting radiation. Therefore, the diffused radiation from the building surfaces is also contributing to the mean radiant temperature. During night-time, we see that the mean radiant temperature gradually reduces. This is due to the nocturnal radiation cooling, where the long-wave radiation from the building surfaces is emitted to the atmosphere during the night, thereby cooling the building surfaces. Trapping of this radiation such as due to cloud cover or even the presence of vegetation can negatively affect the nocturnal radiation cooling.

	\label{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}
\end{figure}

To better investigate the impact of plant shading and the changes in mean radiant temperature in the street-canyon due to vegetation, a single point below the tree at $(x,y,z) = (65, 125, 2)$ is investigated for three different cases: the configuration without vegetation (\textit{None}), a configuration with vegetation but providing only shading (\textit{Shad.}), and a configuration with vegetation providing both shading and plant transpiration (\textit{TR + Shad.}), \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}. \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}a shows the diurnal variation of the direct short-wave radiation intensity $q_{\textit{s,dir}}$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) below the tree. At the presence of vegetation, we see a strong drop in the solar radiation, especially during middays from $q_{dir} \approx 800$ W\,m$^{-2}$ to zero at midday and slightly above zero when the sun is off the solar noon. Therefore, all the solar radiation is intercepted by the foliage providing a strong shading below the tree. The diurnal profile of the mean radiant temperature $T_{\textit{mrt}}$  ($^{\circ}$C), \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}b, shows that shading provides up to $\approx 20$ $^{\circ}$C drop when shaded. This is especially beneficial as the largest temperature drop is found at the time of the highest solar radiation. Thus, shading can be a vital component in improving pedestrian thermal comfort. A detailed investigation of the impact of shading on UTCI is performed in the next section. At night we see that the vegetation instead increases the mean radiant temperature inside the street-canyon. This occurs because vegetation results in a radiation trapping intercepting the long-wave radiation emitted from the urban surfaces to the sky. This phenomenon can, therefore, harm thermal comfort during night time. 

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[p]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figdir/USC_T_type2_v2-crop.pdf}
	\caption{Air temperature $T$ ($^{\circ}$C) inside the street-canyon where the vegetation zone is indicated by a green box. The plot shows the fields with a 150 minutes interval from 03:00 to 23:00 (HH:MM).}
	\label{fig:USC_T}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\cref{fig:USC_T} shows the air temperature $T$ ($^{\circ}$C) inside the street-canyon (i.e., $x-z$ plane at $y=125$ m) allowing to see the influence of vegetation on the air temperature through the diurnal cycle. The air temperature $T$ depicted in the figures results from the net effect of solar radiation, plant shading, thermal storage in buildings and air temperature change due to plant transpiration. It is apparent that the highest air temperature is at building surfaces mainly due to the solar radiation observed in \cref{fig:USC_qrdir}. In the vicinity of the vegetation, a localized small cooler region is present and is due to the air temperature cooling from plant transpiration. The transpirative cooling is predominant from mid-day to afternoon (i.e., 13:00 to 18:00) when the solar radiation is present and so provides cooling when radiation intensity is highest. 

\subsubsection*{Impact of thermal comfort}

The influence of vegetation on pedestrian comfort is determined by evaluating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (\textit{UTCI}) ($^{\circ}$C) \citep{Fiala2001,Manickathan2018a}. We employ the formulation used in \cref{ch:parametricstudy}, however, with a more accurate estimation of the mean radiant temperature, as shown in \cref{eq:Tmrt2}, taking in account of the solar altitude change during the day, long-wave and short-wave radiation emitted and reflected from the urban surfaces. \cref{fig:USC_UTCI} shows the $\textit{UTCI}$ ($^{\circ}$C) inside the street-canyon (i.e., $x-z$ plane at $y=125$ m) at 9 separate time of the day. It is apparent that pedestrian comfort is significantly reduced due to the exposure to solar radiation at noon. However, inside the shaded zone of the trees, the thermal comfort is substantially improved, as indicated by the reduced UTCI values. In contrast, the impact of humidity generated from the trees is not discernible in the UTCI distribution. This means the transpiration of the trees does not negatively affect pedestrian comfort in the case studied, although an increase in relative humidity could reduce the thermal comfort.


\begin{sidewaysfigure}[p]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{\figdir/USC_UTCI_type2-crop.pdf}

	\label{fig:USC_UTCI}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

To better assess the influence of the transpiration and the influence of shading, the air temperature $T$  ($^{\circ}$C) and $UTCI$  ($^{\circ}$C) below the tree at $(x,y,z) = (65, 125, 2)$ for three different cases are studied: i) no vegetation, ii) only shading, and iii) shading and plant transpiration. \cref{fig:profile_T_UTCI} shows the diurnal variation of the air temperature and the comfort index. The calculated \textit{UTCI} shows that the comfort perceived by the pedestrian \textit{with} and \textit{without} transpiration is identical. The perceived change in comfort is simply due to the change in radiative exchanges, influenced by the vegetation. So, the change in the mean radiant temperature, seen in \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}, plays a more important role in thermal comfort. During night time, the UTCI with vegetation is slightly higher and is due to the higher mean radiant temperature observed in \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}. Due to the radiation trapping, the nocturnal UTCI is higher can, therefore, indicate a lower thermal comfort.

\subsubsection*{Influence of water availability}

	\label{fig:energy_collapsed}
\end{figure}

A final aspect that can play a role is the water availability for the plants. As the plant transpires throughout the day, the soil moisture will reduce due to the root water uptake (in addition to soil surface evaporation). Therefore, after a longer period (i.e., days), the soil moisture will be reduced and could have an impact on the plant transpiration rate, directly influence the leaf energy balance.  \cref{fig:profile_psi_gvleaf} shows the long-term evolution of the plant properties such as bulk leaf water potential $\psi_L$ (MPa), bulk root water potential $\psi_R$ (MPa), rhizosphere-averaged soil water potential $\langle \psi_s \rangle$ (MPa), and average plant transpiration rate $\langle g_{\textit{v,leaf}} \rangle$ (g\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$). The rhizosphere-averaged soil water potential is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\langle \psi_s \rangle = \frac{\int_{\Omega_{\textit{soil}}} r \psi_s~\mathrm{d}V}{\int_{\Omega_{\textit{soil}}} r \mathrm{d}V }
\end{equation}
and average plant transpiration rate is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\langle g_{\textit{v,leaf}} \rangle= \frac{\int_{\Omega_{\textit{air}}} a\, g_{\textit{v,leaf}}~\mathrm{d}V}{\int_{\Omega_{\textit{air}}} a~\mathrm{d}V }
\end{equation}

We see that leaf and root water potential varies at two timescales: i) hourly and ii) daily. The hourly cycling behavior is directly correlated with atmospheric conditions such as solar radiation as depicted in \cref{fig:profile_qsdir_Tmrt}. Around early afternoon (i.e., $15$:$00$), when the solar radiation is highest, the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) is at highest, as experimentally observed in \cref{ch:microclimatestudy}. A large transpiration demand is reflected by the large drop in leaf water potential (\cref{fig:profile_psi_gvleaf}a). Similarly, the root water potential becomes more negative, albeit at a lower magnitude than the leaf water potential. The soil water potential follows a similar trend with an even smaller fluctuation between day and night values. However, what is interesting is that the average nocturnal rhizosphere soil water potential is lower than the root water potential. As the night progresses to dawn, we see that soil water potential becomes less negative. It is, therefore, evidence of the hydraulic redistribution \citep{Volpe2013, Huang2017}. The rhizosphere region soil moisture is highest just before dawn and is a common metric used in plant science (i.e., pre-dawn soil water potential). The night-time hydraulic redistribution occurs when the soil water potential near the surface is lower than the bulk root water potential. Therefore, the roots act as a mechanism to redistribute the lower-ground water where the water potential is higher (i.e., more saturated), to upper layers of the rhizosphere through the roots. The advantage is the near-surface soil can be re-moisturized, improving surface evaporative cooling or provide ecological support to ground level vegetation such as grass. The study shows the importance of deep-rooted vegetation which can access the water near the water table and redistribute to regions of driest soil where the soil water potential is lowest.

\cref{fig:profile_psi_gvleaf}b shows the variation in the average plant transpiration rate. The plant transpiration is correlated with the leaf water potential as they are directly dependent, with peak plant transpiration around early afternoon ($15$:$00$).  The long-term dynamics of water availability is also visible in the \cref{fig:profile_psi_gvleaf}. As the number of days passes, a larger gradient in the leaf and root water potential is required to provide the adequate transpiration needed by the atmospheric demand. Furthermore, after day 20, we observe an exponential behavior in the daily variability indicating that plants are more susceptible after an extended period of low soil moisture. Furthermore, if we quantify water stress as a difference between the leaf and soil water potential, we see that plant water stress increases exponentially as the day passes. \cref{fig:profile_gvleaf_collapsed} shows the plant transpiration rate $\langle g_{\textit{v,leaf}} \rangle$ (g\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$), where all the 25 days are collapsed to an hourly plot. We see that with an increasing number of days without irrigation, the plant transpiration decays throughout the day and is proportional to the strength of the plant transpiration. So, the largest drop in plant transpiration is observed at peak solar hour.

To understand how the decaying transpiration rate affects the plant energy balance, the hourly variation of the average sensible heat flux $\langle q_{\textit{sen,leaf}} \rangle$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) and  average latent heat flux $\langle q_{\textit{lat,leaf}} \rangle$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) is investigated, \cref{fig:energy_collapsed}. The figure shows that with reducing water availability, the sensible heat flux increases throughout the day with an equal reduction in the latent heat flux. The study shows the importance of the regular irrigation of the vegetation. Without adequate irrigation, a lack of water for plant transpiration can remove the transpirative cooling effect observed in \cref{fig:profile_T_UTCI}. If the amount of water in the soil reaches the permanent wilting point $\psi = \num{-1.5e6}$ (Pa), it is known that plant can no longer transpire due to loss of cell turgidity \citep{Idso1977}. So, to ensure the health of the plant, it is important that plants are regularly irrigated. The study showed that, with an increasing number of days (for the previous irrigation), the need for irrigation grows exponentially, reflected by the water stress.

Finally, the influence of water availability on thermal comfort is not observable. This is because, the $UTCI$  ($^{\circ}$C) is identical as shown in \cref{fig:profile_T_UTCI}b. This is because the shading provided by vegetation plays a more important role in thermal comfort. However, an interesting aspect that could be investigated is the influence of water availability on the leaf area density $a$. A wilting of the plant could potentially reduce the shadowing provided by vegetation, which can influence thermal comfort. However, in the present study, this aspect is not investigated.


\subsection{Conclusion}

The present study investigates the influence of transpirative and tree shading on the microclimate of a street canyon. The study shows that transpiration has a direct influence in the plant vicinity air temperature and negligible effects the thermal comfort measured through the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). In contrast, the shading provided by vegetation has a large influence on the street-canyon mean radiant temperature with a drop of around $18$ ($^{\circ}$C) in the shadow. A significant drop in the mean radiant temperature means a substantial improvement in the measured thermal comfort. An important aspect of vegetation that should be taken into account is the nocturnal radiation trapping due to the presence of vegetation. At night, due to obstruction of long-wave radiation emission from urban surfaces to the sky, the mean radiant temperature and similarly the UTCI is higher during night time. It indicates that vegetation counter-intuitively stagnates the cooling of cities during the night. So, cities to not ignore this contribution of vegetation when employing UHI mitigation measures using vegetation.

Another aspect that also plays an important role is water availability. With an increasing number of days without irrigation, the soil loses the available water for the plant transpiration. We observed that due to this, the transpiration rate decays, resulting in an increase in the sensible heat flux from vegetation. Furthermore, a prolonged period without irrigation is shown to increase the water stress of the plant (i.e., the difference between leaf and soil water potential), which increases at an exponential rate. Therefore, the demand for irrigation also grows exponential with time. Urban vegetation irrigation measure should, therefore, take into account the growth in water stress when exposed to a prolonged period of drought. Such conditions can be more frequent in today's changing climate. Finally, the complex modeling approach implemented in this study can capture import plant dynamics such as hydraulic redistribution. It can have an important contribution to the water availability of the shallow-rooted plant species such as grass or small shrubs.


\section{Case study: Muensterhof}

The Muensterhof case study demonstrates the application of the developed model to a realistic urban setting. The Muensterhof is a town square within the city of Zurich with that currently lacks vegetation. In this study, we investigate the influence of vegetation and the impact on the atmospheric conditions such as air temperature, relative humidity and furthermore, the contribution of foliage to intercepting the short-wave radiation. 

\subsection{Simulation setup}

The simulation is performed focusing on the Muensterhof square. Therefore, highest level of building details is found near the square and to increase the computation performance, the level of detail is reduced further away from the square. Similarly, the mesh is refined with highest level of refinement inside the Muensterhof square. \cref{fig:mesh_resolution_muensterhof_tree} shows the surface layer close to the building walls with a single isolated tree inside the square. The numerical domain is discretized into $\num{4432297}$ cells with minimum cell size of $\num{2.38e-3}$ m$^{3}$ near the building.

The location of the tree is chosen based on the requirements of the city of Zurich. The eastern exit towards the river Limmat is required to be unrestricted to enable transport to and from Muensterhof square. Furthermore, the center of the Muensterhof is required to be unrestricted to provide space of public events. A possible region that can be utilized for trees is near the north-east corner of the square, as indicated in \cref{fig:mesh_resolution_muensterhof_tree}. Therefore, a tree was placed at this location to study the influence of vegetation. The tree has a radius of $4$ m and a high of $10$ m with foliage base at $2$ m. The simulation is driven with boundary condition obtained from mesoscale simulation of Zurich, see \cref{fig:muensterhof_bc}. The solar radiation intensity and the wall function are applied as described in the previous sections. Similarly, the plant properties are set to similar that of the previous study of vegetation in the urban street canyon. 

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

The simulation is ran for two different configuration: \textit{with} and \textit{without} tree. \cref{fig:T_muensterhof} shows the air temperature $T$ ($^{\circ}$C) at $z=4$ m (i.e., $x-y$ plane) at 3 different time of the day (9 am, 12 pm, and 3 pm). The tree is outlined using a white outline to indicate its location. We see that there is a small drop in the air temperature in the vicinity of the foliage. Furthermore, near-tree building wall temperature is lower, especially at $12$:$00$. Although, it is apparent that the magnitude of temperature change resulted from the tree is much lower than the spatial variability in temperature in the domain. For examples, the eastern exit is seen to convect cool air into the Muensterhof with air temperature lower than the transpirative cooling provided by vegetation. We see that the contribution of a single tree in this domain provides a negligible change in the air temperature. A more interesting question would be the influence of transpirative cooling with a much higher vegetation density in the Muensterhof. The main limitation of such research is whether is it applicable in reality due to design constraints in the square, limited by the regulations.

\cref{fig:w_muensterhof} shows the humidity ratio  $w$ (g\,kg$^{-1}$) at $z=4$ m for the three times of the day. We see that vegetation is an important source of humidity in the Muensterhof as high values of humidity ratio is convected from the foliage. Due to the wind direction, the humidity is most convected towards the building. It could potential have an influence on the moisture content of the building walls and thereby influencing cooling from evaporative drying of the surfaces. \cref{fig:qsdir_muensterhof} shows direct short-wave radiation intensity $q_{\textit{s,dir}}$ (W\,m$^{-2}$) and the interception of solar radition by the foliage. It is apparent that tree provides shading throughout the day. As we determined in the previous section, solar radiation is an important contributor to thermal comfort. We see that depending on the solar angle, the location of shading provided by the tree varies in location. Therefore, the location of the tree can be modified (to a certain extend) to optimize for the cool effect of vegetation due shading.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The goal of the present study was to demonstrate the application of the developed numerical model in a realistic setup. Muensterhof in Zurich was chosen due to its high interest in urban reforestation by the Zurich city council (DE: Stadrat). The study showed how vegetation modifies the air temperature, humidity ratio and the short-wave radiation inside Muensterhof. It was seen that the air temperature change due to a single tree in minimal in the domain in contrast to the heating of the air due to buildings. A similar conclusion was obtained in the previous section, investigating the influence of vegetation in an urban street canyon. It was found that the most significant contributor towards improving thermal comfort is solar radiation. In Muensterhof, it was seen that the tree provides shading throughout the day with shadowing depending on the solar angle. In the future, more detailed studies can be performed to optimize the shadowing providing in the Muensterhof square. It is recommended that focusing on the shading can provide the maximum improvement in thermal comfort. Furthermore, building walls will also have a cooler temperature due to the reduced solar radiation absorption. However, it must be noted that the location of the tree is highly limited by city regulations. The exits of the square and the center of the square are required to be undisturbed to enable transit and public event use, respectively.
