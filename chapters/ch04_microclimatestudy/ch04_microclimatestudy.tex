\section{Introduction}
\lettrine[lines=3,nindent=0em,loversize=0.1]{T}{his} chapter focuses on assessing the impact of vegetation on the microclimate through experimental investigation. The aim of the chapter is to quantify the influence of wind and radiation on the diurnal response of the plant. The influence of vegetation on the microclimate is studied in the wind tunnel using a small \textit{Buxus sempervirens} plant. In the study, the diurnal dynamics of the plant microclimate of a \textit{Buxus sempervirens} are investigated using various high-resolution non-intrusive imaging techniques. The wake flow field is measured using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV), the spatiotemporal leaf temperature history is obtained using infrared thermography, and the plant microstructure metrics such as plant porosity, leaf area density (LAD) is obtained through X-ray tomography. We find that the wake velocity statistics are not directly linked with the distribution of the porosity but depend mainly on the geometry of the plant foliage which generates the shear flow. The interaction between the shear regions and the upstream boundary layer profile is seen to have a dominant effect on the wake turbulent kinetic energy distribution. Furthermore, the leaf area density distribution has a direct impact on the short-wave radiative heat flux absorption inside the foliage where 50\% of the radiation is calculated to be absorbed in the top 20\% of the foliage. This localized radiation absorption increases the leaf and air temperature substantially, but locally. Furthermore, a comparison of the diurnal variation in the leaf temperature and the net plant transpiration rate enabled us to quantify the diurnal hysteresis resulting from the stomatal response lag. The day of this plant is seen to comprise of four distinct stages of climatic conditions: \textit{no-cooling}, \textit{high-cooling}, \textit{equilibrium}, and \textit{decaying-cooling} stages. The present chapter shows the need for a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum modeling approach to take into account the water availability. With such a modeling approach, the plant transpiration is linked with the soil moisture content. The high-resolution measurement dataset obtained from this chapter is used to compare a simplified version of the fully-coupled numerical model (see \cref{ch:numericalmethod}) in \cref{ch:wtcfdcomparison}. The simplified model is used for comparison as the present measurement campaign still lacks the necessary parameters for an accurate calibration of the full-model, such as the plant xylem properties and rhizosphere properties. The present study only focused on the atmospheric changes due to the plant transpiration. In the future, a multi-domain measurement campaign consisting of measurements of air domain, soil domain, and plant physiology, can enable the validation of the full model. 


%\section{Introduction}

%The influence of plants on the microclimate in an urban environment is of growing interest due to the need of mitigating detrimental effects of urbanization and climate change on urban air temperature \citep{Chen2006,Demuzere2014,Dimoudi2003,Matthews2017,Shashua-Bar2009b,Shashua-Bar2000a}. Plants modify the climate by intercepting solar radiation and by extracting heat from the environment through transpiration during photosynthesis \citep{nobel2009physicochemical}. Furthermore, the plant interferes with the airflow, extracting momentum and enhancing turbulent mixing \citep{Finnigan2009, Gromke2014, Sanz2003}. Due to the present growing need to ensure that cities are resilient and can mitigate the rising temperatures, proposed mitigation strategies are to be properly assessed and such assessment requires an adequate characterization of the effects of vegetation. 

%Foliage density is known to have an impact on the wind sheltering provided by a plant \citep{Bitog2012b,Bitog2011b,Guan2003,Manickathan2018b}. The aerodynamic properties of vegetation can be expressed simply through porosity and drag coefficient \citep{Grant1998,Guan2003,Manickathan2018b}. The porosity and drag coefficient are known to depend on plant species \citep{Cao2012,Manickathan2018b,Rudnicki2004,Vollsinger2005}, age \citep{Dahle2010} and, for deciduous plants that shed leaves during winter, the parameters have been observed to vary seasonally as well \citep{Dellwik2019,Hwang2011,Maass1995}. It is known that plant porosity can have an impact on turbulent mixing \citep{Bai2012,Hiraoka2008,Manickathan2018b,McClure2017}, which is seen to directly impact the thermal and pollutant dispersion characteristics of air flow \citep{Conan2015,Gromke2008,Gromke2015c,Gromke2008a}. Plants with high foliage density are seen to have a detrimental effect on pollutant dispersion of below-canopy pollutant sources such as automobiles \citep{Nowak2006}. Nevertheless, a high foliage density is also shown to have a beneficial impact on the pedestrian thermal comfort due to increased shading provided by the plant \citep{Hwang2011,Morakinyo2017,Ng2012}. Foliage density is parameterized using the leaf area index (LAI) to describe the net area of leaves and leaf area density (LAD) to describe the foliage distribution within the plant volume. These parameters are typically measured using optical techniques \citep{Cao2012,Grant1998,Guan2003,Liu2018,Manickathan2018b,Phattaralerphong2005} that may compromise on the spatial accuracy and destructive techniques such as defoliation of the plant \citep{Jonckheere2004,ONeal2002}. Solar radiation absorption within the foliage is known to depend primarily on the distribution of the leaf area density \citep{Kichah2012,Manickathan2018a,Park2018}.  A dense plant canopy can result in a significant amount of solar radiation being absorbed resulting in a high leaf-to-air temperature \citep{Hiraoka2005,Leuzinger2007,Manickathan2018a}. Higher plant transpiration is then required to compensate for the high solar radiation absorption \citep{Manickathan2018b}, and this can result in a lower air temperature under the foliage \citep{Wong2003}. Studies have also revealed that plant transpiration rate varies not just due to atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) \citep{Kichah2012,Manickathan2018a,McVicar2012,Tuzet2003} but can also dynamically vary during the day with higher transpiration during morning than in the evening \citep{Huang2017,Tuzet2003}. Therefore, experimental observations allow to determine the diurnal variability in the transpirative cooling performance of vegetation.

%Various experimental approaches have been employed to assess the response of plants to environmental conditions ranging from field measurements \citep{Dellwik2019,Grant1998,Hagishima2007,Koizumi2016,Shashua-Bar2009b,Shashua-Bar2000a,Yuan2017}, greenhouse studies \citep{Fatnassi2006,Ganguly2009,Majdoubi2009,Montero2001}, and wind tunnel experiments \citep{Grace1977,Liu2018,Manickathan2018b,Miri2019,Rudnicki2004,Vollsinger2005,Yue2008}. Wind tunnel experiments, which provide the most control over the airflow conditions, typically focus on the aerodynamic characteristics such as drag coefficient, porosity, and sheltering effect of plants and neglect the hygrothermal responses of the plant \citep{Grace1977,Manickathan2018b}. Therefore, the relationship between porosity heterogeneity and hygrothermal conditions of plants has yet not been to be experimentally observed and characterized. Moreover, few studies provide a high-resolution temporal and spatial study of the hygrothermal conditions of the plant which can be used for validating numerical models. Thus, there is a need for high-resolution experimental datasets investigating the links between plant morphology, and atmospheric conditions including diurnal variations of the hygrothermal conditions such as air temperature, and relative humidity and how all of these affect plant conditions. 

The goal of the study is to experimentally quantify the influence of plant foliage geometry and environmental conditions such as wind speed and solar radiation on the transpirative cooling performance of a plant (Buxus sempervirens) inside a wind tunnel in an integrated approach. This is achieved by using multiple non-intrusive imaging techniques, thus measuring the plant foliage density with X-ray tomography, the wake flow field using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV), the plant leaf temperature with infrared thermography and the hygrothermal conditions inside the foliage using various humidity and temperature sensors. The advantage of X-ray tomography to determine the plant porosity is that it is a non-intrusive approach of determining the plant structure, thus the plant can undergo a series of additional experiments. This approach is inspired from the field of building physics where, for example, the determination of the microstructural morphology of building materials such as asphalt \citep{Lal2016,Lal2017} or materials such as cotton textiles \citep{Parada2017} is used to link the material configuration to its wetting and drying behavior. Thus, the approach allows us to quantify the impact of the plant foliage morphology on the wake flow characteristics, the hygrothermal conditions such as air temperature and relative humidity inside the plant foliage, the solar radiation penetration through the foliage and, finally, on the spatial distribution of the leaf temperature. 

The study aims to answer the questions of how plant cooling varies spatially and temporally under variations of environmental conditions such as wind speed and solar radiation and whether a typical diurnal response of the plant could be defined. Moreover, the experiment provides a high-resolution dataset for future modeling validation studies. Given that this investigation is performed in a wind tunnel, we study the diurnal microclimate of a small plant. As we need to ensure low blockage ratio in the wind tunnel, it is not feasible to put a mature tree in the wind tunnel. For example, the size of the plant, the flexibility of the branches and foliage, etc. can have an influence on the plant aerodynamic responses \citep{DeLangre2008,Manickathan2018b}. 

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Materials}


The measurement campaign was performed for a small Buxus plant (Buxus sempervirens) in a wind tunnel as shown in \cref{fig:plant_setup}. The plant foliage has a dimension $20\times20\times21$ cm$^3$ ($x\times y\times z$, i.e., streamwise, spanwise and vertical) as shown in Fig. \cref{fig:plant_setup}b. The plant was placed in a pot, sealed using putty sealant to ensure water was lost only through leaf transpiration (\cref{fig:plant_setup}c). The water loss due to transpiration was periodically compensated by adding fertilized water ($1$\% (vol.) NPK 7-4-6 Buxus fertilizer). Prior to the experiment, the plant was periodically irrigated and exposed for one week to artificial sunlight with a 12-hour day-night cycle, where day is assumed to be a fixed-intensity photoperiod. The artificial sunlight was provided using an Osram Ultra-Vitalux $300$ W solar simulator bulb, generating $13.6$ W of UVA and $3.0$ W of UVB. The bulb was placed 60 cm above the plant to provide $100$ W\,m$^{-2}$ plant-canopy incident short-wave radiation. Furthermore, the growth of the plant foliage was periodically trimmed to maintain the desired plant geometry as shown in \cref{fig:plant_setup}. The detailed measurement of the plant morphology including geometry, porosity distribution, leaf size distribution, and total leaf area, was obtained using a high-resolution X-ray tomography measurement, as explained below.

	\label{fig:plant_setup}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Experimental setup and procedure}

The experimental campaign was divided into three stages: \textit{offline} plant morphology measurement, pre-experimental controlled acclimatization setup, and the wind tunnel experiment. The \textit{offline} measurement aimed to determine the plant morphological properties such as leaf area, porosity and porosity distribution using high-resolution X-ray imaging \cref{subsec:xray}. The aim of the pre-experiment control setup was to acclimatize the plant to the wind tunnel boundary condition of solar radiation diurnal cycle. Furthermore, the sensors required for measuring the air and leaf temperature and air relative humidity within the foliage are mounted at this stage. Finally, the wind tunnel experiment aims at documenting the environmental conditions of the plant subjected to moderate wind. Thus, the flow field downstream of the plant, the hygrothermal microclimate inside the plant, the net transpiration rate and the plant foliage thermal profiles are measured.

\subsection{X-ray imaging}
\label{subsec:xray}

A high-resolution computed tomography (X-ray CT) of the plant is acquired to determine the foliage morphology, the foliage porosity distribution and the net leaf area. The advantage of such an approach is that it is a non-intrusive approach where the same plant can be further investigated \citep{Lal2017,Patera2018}. The measurement is performed at the Diagnostic Imaging Research Unit (DIRU) at the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, using a Philips Brilliance CT 16-slice scanner, shown in \cref{fig:xrayimaging}, designed for medical imaging with an acquisition period of $39$ seconds. The CT slices have a resolution of $0.318\times0.318$  mm$^2$ pixel with a slice thickness of $0.4$ mm. The 12-bit image intensity data and the associated data of the measurement are stored in DICOM file format. The plant properties such as net leaf area are obtained from the 3D dataset after image processing, consisting of image enhancement, image segmentation, and classification.

%The resulting X-ray radiation intensity $I$ decay along the path $r$ is dependent on the initial intensity $I_0$ and the spatial distribution of the attenuation coefficient $\mu$ along the path $r$, given by the Beer-Lamberts law:
%\begin{equation}
%I(r) = {I_0}\exp \left\{ { - \int\limits_0^r {\mu \left( r \right){\mathrm{d}}r} } \right\}
%\end{equation}

The plant attenuation is represented in Hounsfield units (HU) where $-1000$ corresponds to air and $0$ corresponds to pure water. The image slice resolution is $\Delta x = \Delta z=0.318$ mm with a slice thickness of $\Delta y=0.4$ mm.}
	\label{fig:figure_rawimage}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{X-ray computed tomography}

The attenuation coefficient indicates the absorption of the biological material to X-ray radiation, indicating the variability in the biological composition of the sample. The reconstructed tomographic data provides the 3D distribution of X-ray attenuation by the sample. The Hounsfield scaling normalizes the X-ray attenuation coefficient $\mu$ with that of the air $\mu_{\textit{air}}$ and distilled water $\mu_{\textit{water}}$ at standard atmospheric conditions, where the Hounsfield units of air and water are $HU_{\textit{air}}=-1000$ and $HU_{\textit{water}}=0$, respectively:
\begin{equation}
HU = 1000 \times \frac{{\mu  - {\mu _{\textit{water}}}}}{{{\mu _{\textit{water}}} - {\mu _{\textit{air}}}}}
\end{equation}
HU can be used to extract the biological properties of the plant as the scaling can be a means for fast and simple categorization of biological matter with different water quantity. 

\subsubsection*{Image segmentation}


\begin{sidewaysfigure}[p]
%\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figdir/figure_segentation_poster.png}
	\caption{Segmentation of the X-ray CT scan: \subfig{a} slice of original X-ray CT dataset, \subfig{b} segmentation using user-defined histogram threshold and \subfig{c} segmentation using Trainable WEKA Segmentation and additional morphological operation (opening + closing). Only a sub-region of an image slice is shown for clarity. The segmented pixels are labeled as air ($0$, purple), leaf ($1$, blue) and branch ($2$, yellow).}
	\label{fig:xrayctslice}
%\end{figure}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\cref{fig:figure_rawimage}a shows a side-view of the CT-scan, whereas \cref{fig:figure_rawimage}b shows a single image slice at the middle of the plant. \cref{fig:figure_rawimage}c shows the histogram distribution of the single image slice. A preliminary observation of the images is that air, leaf, and branch show distinct attenuation coefficients for which a manual thresholding of the histogram is performed. Based on the histogram, a simple segmentation assigns air, leaves, and branches. The pixels are assigned as for air ($-1000$ to $900$), leaves ($-900$ to $-700$), branches ($-700$ to $200$), and anything beyond as foreign material. The bounds are determined with the help of $k$-means clustering method assuming a tri-modal distribution (i.e., $k=3$) of the histogram. The histogram of X-ray CT scan (\cref{fig:xrayctslice}c) shows that this assumption is not valid as a clear differentiation between each mode is not visible. However, this histography-based segmentation serves as a base case for the more advanced segmentation algorithm. \cref{fig:xrayctslice}a shows the original dataset before the classification into air,leaves and brnaches. \cref{fig:xrayctslice}b shows the histogram-based classification labels. A first observation shows a reasonable classification of the dataset except at boundaries of the branches, due to lower attenuation at the boundaries of the objects.

Therefore, a more advanced approach, the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS) \citep{Arganda-Carreras2017} and additional binary morphological operations are used for classification of the three components of the tree. The TWS segmentation employs an implementation of fast random forest ensemble classification algorithm in the Fiji application \citep{Schindelin2012a} using $200$ decision trees with $2$ random features from user selection. A larger selection of edge-enhancement filters is used to reduce the over-estimation of the leaves at the boundary. The training procedure consisted of providing an initially labeled training dataset, trained using the classifier, visually validating the classification, and improving the user-provided labeled training dataset for improved classification. Finally, small remaining leaf pixels at the boundary of the branches were removed using additional morphological operations (\textit{opening} + \textit{closing} \citep{Haralick1987}) using the python library, \texttt{scikit-image} \citep{VanderWalt2014a}. \cref{fig:xrayctslice}c shows the resulting segmentation using the decision tree classification and morphological operation. The \cref{fig:xrayctslice}c shows a better classification of the plant elements than \cref{fig:xrayctslice}b. From this processed dataset, the plant surface mesh for branches and leaves can be generated to obtain metrics such as net leaf surface area.


\subsection{Wind tunnel setup}
\label{subsec:windtunnelsetup}

The measurement setup is an integrated measurement approach for simultaneously measuring multiple microclimate parameters. The climate measurements consisted of the measurement of the air relative humidity, air temperature, the net plant transpiration, and the flow velocity. The measurements were performed inside the ETHZ / Empa Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) wind tunnel, a closed-circuit G\"ottingen type wind tunnel with a test section cross-section of $1.9\times1.3$ m$^2$ ($W\times H$). The blockage ratio (i.e., the frontal area of the plant to wind tunnel cross-section) of the plant is determined to be $1.7$\%. \cref{fig:plant_setup}a shows the wind tunnel setup that is employed to ensure minimal disturbances from measurement instruments. During the microclimate measurement, the diurnal variations of the air temperature and relative humidity at different heights were recorded using RH/T (i.e., combined relative humidity and temperature measurement) sensors. In addition, the leaf temperature was measured using infrared thermography. The net transpiration rate from the plant was measured using a mass balance positioned below the wind tunnel floor through an access panel, ensuring that the disturbance of the air flow is affected by the presence of the plant only (\cref{fig:plant_setup}b). The airflow leeward of the plant was measured using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV). 

%The \textit{online} measurement consists of microclimate measurement, where humidity, temperature, and net transpiration rate are measured and airflow measurement, where the wake-flow of the plant is measured. The measured are performed inside the ETHZ / Empa Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) wind tunnel, a closed circuit Göttingen type wind tunnel with a test section cross-section of $1.9\times1.3$ m$^2$ ($W\times H$). The blockage ratio resulted from the plant is $1.7$\%. \cref{fig:plant_setup}a shows the wind tunnel setup that is employed to ensure minimal disturbances from measurement instruments. During the microclimate measurement, the diurnal variation of the air temperature and humidity distribution are recorded using thermocouples and RH/T sensors. Furthermore, the leaf temperatures are measured using an infrared thermography. Additionally, the net transpiration rate from the plant is measured using a mass balance hidden below the wind tunnel through an access panel, ensuring that the disturbance of the air flow is minimized  (\cref{fig:fullsetup}). The coupled measurement setup can be considered as an integrated measurement approach for simultaneously measuring multiple microclimate parameters. Thereafter, the airflow behind the plant is measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV).

	\label{fig:incomingvelocityprofile}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Microclimate boundary conditions}
A parametric study on the steady-state and dynamic response of the plant exposed to four environmental conditions was performed: two wind tunnel set wind speeds, $0$ and $1$ m\,s$^{-2}$, and two plant-canopy incident solar radiation levels, $0$ and $100$ W\,m$^{-2}$. A $100$ W\,m$^{-2}$ was seen to be a safe regime for the small buxus plant as a much higher solar radiation intensity was seen to wilt the plant-canopy leaves. The air temperature and the relative humidity inside the wind tunnel were $21$ $^{\circ}$C and $25$\% RH, where the condition was coarsely regulated by the HVAC system of the wind tunnel facility. 

\cref{fig:incomingvelocityprofile} shows the vertical profiles of the mean upstream streamwise velocity and the Reynolds stresses measured in the empty tunnel at the future position of the plant. At plant canopy height,  $H=210$ mm, the measured mean velocity is $U_H=0.77$ m\,s$^{-1}$  for the wind speed of $U_{\textit{ref}}=1$ m\,s$^{-1}$ (i.e., the set wind tunnel wind speed). The wind tunnel flow was modified using turbulence generators, as shown in \cref{fig:plant_setup}a, to generate an appropriate ABL profile typically found in an urban context \citep{Tsalicoglou2018}. However, a detailed consideration of the scaling of velocity profile with the tree height was not performed. The profile was chosen to simply mimic the wind profile of an urban area. \cref{fig:incomingvelocityprofile} shows the mean velocity and variance of velocity profiles that is typical for an ABL, with a turbulent intensity $I=\sqrt{2⁄3\,k}/U_{\textit{ref}}= 12.1$\%. This turbulence intensity thus exposed the plant foliage to air flow characteristics of an urban boundary profile. 


\subsubsection*{SPIV setup}
A stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) setup was used to measure the time-averaged 3D wake structure of the plant. To reconstruct the full 3D wake of the plant, the SPIV setup is traversed eight times vertically from $60$ mm from the ground upwards to $270$ mm, at $30$ mm intervals, to produce eight SPIV planes, as depicted in \cref{fig:fullsetup}a. The time-averaged measurements of each plane are then combined to generate a 3D velocity field of the plant wake flow and its associated turbulence statistics. 

The SPIV measurement setup consists of two $2560 \times 2160$ pixel s-CMOS HiSense Zyla camera and a $200$ mJ\,pulse$^{-1}$ (at $15$ Hz) Nd-YAG Litron laser which is traversed together using a high-precision system. The two cameras are placed at $38^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}$ normal to the imaging plane. The wind tunnel is seeded with $1$ $\mu$m Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacat (DEHS) tracer particles and the velocity vectors are calculated using an iterative cross-correlation algorithm of Dantec DynamicStudio with final interrogation area of $32\times32$ px$^2$ and $50$\%  overlap. The field of view (FOV) of a SPIV plane is $438\times559$ mm$^2$ and provides \num{69015} PIV vectors per plane with an in-plane resolution of $2.5$ mm, whereas the plane-to-plane resolution is $30$ mm. To obtain statistically relevant turbulence characteristics, $\num{5000}$ images are obtained at $15$ Hz. Furthermore, to ensure low optical inferences during the SPIV measurement, the hygrothermal measurement devices, thermal imaging devices, and the solar lamp had to be removed. The two distinct setups for airflow measurement and hygrothermal measurement are shown in \cref{fig:fullsetup}a and \cref{fig:fullsetup}b, respectively. Furthermore, we assume that the influence of removed devices is minimal for low wind speeds, such as in our case.

\subsubsection*{Microclimate and net transpiration rate measurement}
The hygrothermal microclimate conditions within the foliage at various wind and radiation conditions are investigated separately from the flow field measurements, as clarified in \cref{fig:fullsetup}. \cref{fig:fullsetup}b shows the setup used to measure the hygrothermal microclimate of the plant. The solar simulator is placed above the plant providing $100$ W\,m$^{-2}$ of incident short-wave radiation at the plant canopy ($H=210$ mm). The solar simulator is controlled using a time switch that provides 12-hour periods of $0$ and $100$ W\,m$^{-2}$ radiation in alternance, imposing a simplified diurnal solar cycle. A fixed radiation intensity was imposed to obtain the steady-state response on the plant. In future, a time-dependent intensity profile such as sine profile can be investigated. The net plant transpiration is measured using a Mettler PM6100 mass balance placed below the wind tunnel floor in the instrument bay along with the plant pot and water reservoir and the data acquisition system, to minimize their inferences on the flow field. The mass balance has a maximum capacity of $6.1$ kg with an accuracy of ($\pm 0.1$ g). Simultaneously, the vertical relative humidity and temperature profiles inside the plant are measured using Sensirion SHT35 sensors, as indicated in \cref{fig:fullsetup}b. Seven SHT sensors are placed as follows: five sensors are directly inside the foliage with a vertical offset of $30$ mm starting below the plant canopy (i.e., $z=[60,90,120,150,180]$ mm), one sensor is at plant canopy (i.e., $z=210$ mm), and one sensor is below the plant foliage near the ground (i.e. $z=0$ mm), to measure the shaded conditions. An additional sensor is placed directly downstream of the plant at the height of plant canopy (i.e., $z=210$ mm). The eight SHT sensors have an accuracy of $\pm1.5$\% RH (between $0$ and $80$\% RH) and $\pm0.1$ $^{\circ}$C (between $20$ and $60$ $^{\circ}$C). All the sensors for the plant are connected and powered by the wireless data acquisition system directly below the plant pot, such system is necessary to not hinder the mass balance measurement of water loss due to transpiration. The wireless data acquisition system consists of an Arduino Micro and a $\num{20100}$ mAh powerbank providing the necessary power for a multi-day measurement period. The Arduino Micro serves not only as an analog-to-digital signal converter but also as a telemetry device for sending the acquired data to the data logger away from the measurement setup. The data is acquired at a 30-second interval. 


\subsubsection*{Infrared imaging}
Infrared (IR) thermography is performed to obtain a high-resolution spatial and temporal data of the foliage temperature when exposed to varying environmental conditions. The feasibility of employing infrared thermography to obtain leaf temperature variability has been demonstrated in the past \citep{Jones1999,Merlot2002}. IR imaging system is employed to measure the outer plant foliage temperature simultaneously with the hygrothermal and net transpiration rate measured for two different wind conditions throughout the diurnal radiation cycle. The IR imaging system consists of the Optris PI 640 IR camera with a $640\times480$ px$^2$ sensor, a spectral response between $7.5$ and $13$ $\mu$m and is set to measure $-20$ to $100$ $^{\circ}$C  with an accuracy of $\pm2$ $^{\circ}$C  \citep{Allegrini2018,Tsalicoglou2018}. A $33^{\circ}$ lens is used providing an effective FOV of $223\times211$ mm$^2$. The IR measurement is performed at a frequency of 1 frame\,minute$^{-1}$ throughout the diurnal cycle. A PT100 (platinum resistance thermometer) sensor is placed in FOV of the IR image for calibration \citep{Allegrini2018}.


\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{X-ray tomography: A non-destructive approach to obtain plant traits}
\label{subsec:xraytomo}

\subsubsection*{Plant porosity distribution} 

\cref{fig:porositydistribution}a shows the average porosity for representative elementary volumes (REV) of voxel sizes ranging from $5$ to $100$ px$^3$. To calculate the spatial distribution of plant porosity, a sufficiently large REV has to be chosen to ensure that variability in the plant microstructure is taken into account. However, if the REV is too large, it sacrifices the resolution of the porosity distribution. If the REV size is $100$ px$^3$, the resulting porosity is $\langle \phi \rangle_{\textit{xyz}}  = 90$\%. However, the downside of such a large REV size is that it has scarified the spatial resolution of porosity distribution. Therefore, in our case, an REV size of $30$ px$^3$ was seen to be optimal, providing sufficient accuracy and resolution, with a calculated average plant porosity of $\langle \phi \rangle_{\textit{xyz}} = 88$\%. \cref{fig:porositydistribution}a also shows the average porosity obtained from both \textit{weka} segmentation and the \textit{histogram} segmentation methodology as described in \cref{subsec:xray}. We see that both approaches follow the same profile with minor differences. This result indicates that both approaches accurately differentiates air space and biological material. However, in \cref{subsec:xray}, it was seen that the \textit{weka} method provides a better classification of leaf and branches, as visible in \cref{fig:xrayctslice}. So, to obtain key parameters such as leaf surface area, the \textit{weka} method is opted.

%\end{sidewaysfigure}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:porositydistribution}b shows three vertical distributions of plant porosity. In conjunction with the plant porosity based on the X-ray CT (black line), the optical and aerodynamic porosity of the plant (with respect to the incident airflow direction in the wind tunnel) are investigated. The optical and aerodynamic porosity are typical measures used in the wind tunnel studies to estimate the aerodynamic contribution of the plant porosity \citep{Grant1998,Guan2003,Manickathan2018b}. The optical porosity $\beta$ and the aerodynamic porosity $\alpha$ can be related as follows:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \beta^{0.4}
\end{equation}
empirically derived from wind tunnel measurements \citep{Guan2003}. The optical porosity is obtained from a 2D optical image of the tree perpendicular to the incident flow direction (\cref{fig:porosities}a) and is defined as the ratio of empty pixels (without plant elements) to the total number of pixels within the silhouette of the plant, shown in \cref{fig:porosities}. A convex hull is used to define the silhouette of the plant. Furthermore, the streamwise-averaged plant porosity $\langle \phi \rangle _x$ (\cref{fig:porosities}b) is investigated to quantify how much the plant that is blocking the flow field at a given location. It indicates clearly that the highest blockage is found near the top half of the plant (i.e.,  $\hat{z}=0.75$). Such location of high plant foliage density can lead to high solar radiative absorptions and a resulting high transpiration rate, a hypothesis that will be studied by measuring the air temperature and relative humidity, showing the regions of high transpiration. The plant foliage density is seen to reduce towards to the edges gradually and at these regions, a lower blockage might be present with a higher bleed flow, which can provide internal ventilation, increasing the convective dominated processes such as sensible and latent heat fluxes \citep{Manickathan2018a}. 

\begin{figure}[t]

	\label{fig:porosities}
\end{figure}




The horizontal-averaged ($x-y$ plane) porosity distribution is shown and compared in \cref{fig:porositydistribution}b. Comparing optical, aerodynamic and real 3D-based porosity (i.e., the plant porosity), we see that the real 3D-based porosity of the plant is substantially higher than the optical and the aerodynamic porosities. This indicates that the aerodynamic porosity usually used in various studies \citep{Bitog2011b,Guan2003,Manickathan2018b}, does not reflect the true plant porosity. However, it is still uncertain as to which porosity provides the best description of the impact of the tree on the flow field such as the wake velocity deficit and the turbulent kinetic energy profile. Therefore, the influence of true plane porosity $\phi$ and the aerodynamic porosity $\alpha$ on the wake velocity statistics is investigated in \cref{subsec:stereopiv}.

\subsubsection*{Plant surface mesh and total leaf area}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figdir/plantmesh.png}
	\caption{Surface geometry of the plant, where leaves (green) and branches (orange) are differentiated: \subfig{a} complete plant surface, \subfig{b} sub-volume inside the plant foliage.}
	\label{fig:plantmesh}
\end{figure}

In addition to the porosity distribution of the plant, the total leaf area, leaf area index and leaf area density are important parameters for understanding and modeling the influence of vegetation \citep{Manickathan2018a}. The plant parameters are obtained from X-ray tomography, and the surface of the plant components is generated from the volumetric data of the plant X-ray CT. \cref{fig:plantmesh}a shows the leaf and branch surface colored as green and orange, respectively. \cref{fig:plantmesh}b shows an internal sub-volume of the plant for clarity. The surface geometry is generated using a marching-cube algorithm implemented in \texttt{scikit-image} \citep{VanderWalt2014a}.

The total leaf surface area is determined by integrating the mesh surface and is calculated to be $A_l=0.75$ m$^2$. A metric of plant trait commonly used to quantify the amount of leaves is the leaf area index (LAI). The leaf area is defined as the ratio of one-sided leaf area to the plant ground cover area $A_g$. The one-sided leaf area is simply assumed to be half the total measured leaf area, and the plant ground cover area is derived from the X-ray CT dataset. The plant ground cover was determined to be $A_g=0.031$ m$^2$, and a resulting leaf area index of $\textit{LAI}=12.14$ m$^2$\,m$^{-2}$ is measured. Therefore, the plant is seen to have a high LAI because it is a shrub species that is commonly used as hedgerows or shelterbelts.

The (one-sided) leaf area density $a$ (m$^2$\,m$^{-3}$) (or also known by LAD) is a key parameter that is used to represent vegetation as a porous medium in a numerical models \citep{DeLangre2008,Gross1987,Manickathan2018a}. It is related to the net leaf surface area (two-sided) $A_l$ and the plant porosity $\phi$, given as:
\begin{equation}
a = \frac{1}{2}{A_l}\frac{{1 - \phi }}{{\int {1 - \phi \;{\mathrm{d}}V} }}
\end{equation}

\cref{fig:porositydistribution}c shows the vertical distribution of the horizontally-averaged (i.e., streamwise $x$ and spanwise-averaged $y$) leaf area density $\langle a \rangle_{\textit{xy}}$ (m$^2$\,m$^{-3}$). The leaf area density $a$ has a peak value of $\langle a \rangle_{\textit{xy}}\approx50$ m$^2$\,m$^{-3}$ where the porosity is at lowest and approaches zero at the top and bottom regions of the foliage as $\phi\rightarrow1$. An important aspect of the a distribution is its influence on the solar radiation attenuation within the foliage. The extinction of solar radiation within the foliage due is typically modeled using a simple Beer-Lambert law and can be assumed to depend only on the a distribution and the extinction coefficient of the short-wave radiation $\mu_{\textit{sw}}$ \citep{Manickathan2018a}
and a detailed description is provided in \cref{sec:leafenergy}. \cref{fig:porositydistribution}c also shows the vertical distribution of normalized short-wave radiative flux $\langle q_{\textit{r,sw}} \rangle_{\textit{xy}}$ determined from Beer-Lambert law. We see that nearly $50\%$ of the above-canopy solar radiation intensity $q_{\textit{r,sw,0}}$ is absorbed within just the top $20\%$ of the plant foliage and a further $30\%$ within the next $10\%$ of the foliage. Therefore, most of the solar radiation is seen to be absorbed within the top layer of the plant indicating that the influence of solar radiation will be present at this region \citep{Manickathan2018a}. To investigate this further, the influence of measured leaf area density distribution on the hygrothermal climate variables ($T$, $T_l$, $\textit{RH}$) inside the foliage is investigated in \cref{subsec:diurnal}.


\subsection{3D wake flow characterization by SPIV}
\label{subsec:stereopiv}

The 3D wake flow field is studied using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV). The study aims to understand the influence of the porous plant microstructure on the wake flow characteristics. Therefore, the mean velocity and the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) of the plant wake is studied and compared with the porosity distribution. The setup of the PIV system is detailed in \cref{subsec:windtunnelsetup}, measuring eight horizontal planes behind the plant at vertical heights of $z =$ $[60$, $90$, $120$, $150$, $180$, $210$, $240$, $270]$ mm, heights normalized below to the height of the plant.

\subsubsection*{Normalized mean velocity magnitude}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figdir/hAll_flow_mean_updated.png}
	\caption{Normalized mean velocity magnitude $|\tavg{\mvec{u}}|/U_H$ at 8 horizontal planes, $\hat{z}=$ [$0.29$,\,$0.43$,\,$0.57$, $0.71$, $0.86$, $1.0$, $1.14$, $1.29]$ where the red shaded area indicates the location of the tree. The horizontal plane location is indicated by the red line in the in the sub-box.}
	\label{fig:meanflow}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The time-averaged mean velocity of the plant wake is studied first to understand how the plant porosity influences the flow. \cref{fig:meanflow} shows the normalized mean velocity magnitude  $|\tavg{\mvec{u}}|/U_H$ where $U_H=0.77$ m\,s$^{-1}$. The coordinate system is normalized with the tree height of $H=210$ mm, where $\hat{x}_i=x_i/H$ for $x_i=\{x,y,z\}$. This mean velocity distribution shows a prevailing recirculating flow for $\hat{z} \le 0.71$, whereas above $\hat{z} > 0.71$, the streamlines indicate a bleed flow with $\phi\rightarrow1$ (\cref{fig:porosities}b). To further link the flow field to the climate, the influence of the flow conditions on the hygrothermal microclimate inside the plant will be investigated in \cref{subsec:diurnal}.

\subsubsection*{Turbulent kinetic energy}

\end{sidewaysfigure}

An important impact of trees on the airflow is the modification of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). In literature, several studies emphasize the role of vegetation in turbulence enhancement for urban flows, which can drastically influence the pollution dispersion and thermal characteristics \citep{Amorim2013,Gromke2008,Poggi2004}. The internal structure of the plant is known to affect the budget of TKE directly. In addition to the well-known Richardson-Kolmogorov energy cascade from mean kinetic energy (MKE) to TKE \citep{Pope}, the plant is known to \textit{produce} and \textit{dissipate} the TKE due to the additional shortcut in energy transfer from MKE to TKE and the shortcut from TKE to turbulent dissipation rate (TDR) \citep{Finnigan2000,Wilson1977}. This is due to the plant components interacting with the flow creating strong velocity gradients generating the TKE and the leaves act at turbulence suppressors, increasing the dissipation rate \citep{Kenjeres2013}. The spatial variability in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) of the plant wake is investigated to understand the turbulence modification and link this effect to the plant porosity distribution. \cref{fig:tke} shows the normalized turbulent kinetic $k/U_H^2$ for the 8 horizontal planes. Trivially, the TKE is low above the tree ($\hat{z}>1$) and directly behind the plant (near  $\hat{x}= 0$, $\hat{y}= 0$ mm), where the air speeds are low. In contrast, the TKE is high at the shear zones between high-speed and low-speed zones. Comparing different planes, we see that the TKE profile is high near the ground ($\hat{z}=0.29$) and near the plant canopy ($\hat{z}=1$). This again is attributed to the high shear flows generated from the boundaries of the plant foliage that is present at these two vertical levels.

\subsubsection*{Linking flow field to plant porosity}
	
To better study the influence of plant porosity on the wake flow, the centerline flow statistics and the plant porosity are compared. \cref{fig:verticalprofile} shows the vertical profiles of the center-line velocity at $\hat{y}=0$ for 7 streamwise positions, $\hat{x} =$ $[0.4$, $0.6$, $0.8$, $1.0$, $1.2$, $1.4$, $1.6]$. The vertical profiles consist of streamwise velocity $\tavg{u}/U_H$, the vertical velocity $\tavg{w}/U_H$, and the turbulent kinetic energy $k/U_H^2$. Furthermore, to determine the relation between plant porosity distribution and wake flow field, the vertical streamwise-averaged porosity distributio $\langle \phi \rangle_x$ and aerodynamic porosity $\alpha$, obtained from \cref{fig:porosities}b, is also plotted. We see that both the porosity distributions are only weakly linked to the streamwise velocity $\tavg{u}/U_H$. This is observable at $\hat{z}>0.7$, as porosity approaches $\phi\rightarrow1$, the streamwise velocity increases as well. In contrast, there is no apparent link between the vertical velocity $\tavg{w}/U_H$ or turbulent kinetic energy $k/U_H^2$. Instead, we see that wake velocity deficit is governed by how the upstream wind profile is modified by the shear zones generated the outer geometry of the plant. This is because the ABL inflow condition has a more dominant influence on the wake profile and the resulting shear-layer and recirculation zone (as indicated by the negative streamwise velocity at $\hat{z} <0.5$ and $\hat{x}<0.8$). Therefore, in the present study, we do not observe a direct link between the spatial distribution of the aerodynamic porosity $\alpha$ nor the spatial distribution of the plant porosity $\phi$ with the wake flow statistics. Instead, it is found to be dependent more on the total porosity of the plant and the geometry of the plant foliage. As $\phi \rightarrow 1$, the velocity deficit decreases too. An insight of the influence of total plant porosity on the wake velocity statistics is presented in \cref{subsec:dragcoeff}, where the plant drag is adjusted by varying the drag coefficient instead of the porosity as scaling the drag coefficient is equivalent to scaling the net porosity (see \cref{eq:suu}). We observe that reducing the plant drag, the wake velocity deficit is indeed reduced. Similarly, as plant drag reduces, the TKE is also reduced.

\subsection{Diurnal hygrothermal behavior of the plant}
\label{subsec:diurnal}

A thorough understanding of the plant morphology from \cref{subsec:xraytomo} and the resulting flow characteristics in \cref{subsec:stereopiv} enables us to link plant porosity to the wake flow characteristics. In this section, we investigate the link between plant morphology and the hygrothermal parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity. First, the diurnal response of the plant and its daytime and nighttime averages are investigated. Thereafter, the dynamic characteristics during the transition between day and night are investigated. 

\subsubsection*{Influence of environment on diurnal response}

The diurnal behavior of the plant is investigated for two distinctly different boundary conditions: no-wind condition and wind condition with $U_{ref}=1$ m\,s$^{-1}$. \cref{fig:figure_transpirationrate} shows the diurnal variation of the water mass loss $m$ (g) throughout the day and night and the resulting the transpiration rate $TR$ (g\,h$^{-1}$), defined as:
\begin{equation}
TR = \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}
\end{equation}
measuring the hourly change in mass due to transpiration. We observe that, during the night regardless of the wind condition, a constant transpiration rate of $2.5$ g\,h$^{-1}$ exists. This transpiration rate, in the absence of solar radiation, is therefore associated to the water loss due to dark respiration \citep{Farquhar1980, Lambers2008, Launiainen2015}. At dawn, a strong increase in transpiration rate is observable. Furthermore, at this time, the wind speed plays an important role: with the wind, a peak transpiration rate of $15$ g\,h$^{-1}$ is observed whereas, without wind, the transpiration rate peaks only at $10$ g\,h$^{-1}$. As the day progresses, the stomatal regulation is seen to compensate for the influence of wind, resulting in similar transpiration rate with an average transpiration rate of $9$ g\,h$^{-1}$. The decay in the daytime transpiration after dawn has also been observed previously \citep{Javaux2013, Tuzet2003}. Thus, we see that the day is composed of four unique stages: ``\textit{no-cooling}'' stage, ``\textit{high-cooling}'' stage, ``\textit{equilibrium}'' stage, and finally ``\textit{decaying-cooling}'' stage. The no-cooling period is present at the initial stages of dawn where the leaves absorb solar radiation and the stomatal response has not been prevalent to provide an adequate transpiration rate. Thereafter, there is period of high transpiration (\textit{HC}) and eventually arrives at an pseudo-equilibrium transpiration rate (\textit{EQ}). Towards the end of the day, the transpiration rate remains decaying (referred to as \textit{DC} or \textit{decayed-cooling}). This decaying transpiration phenomenon is most likely attributed to the reduced rhizosphere soil moisture content. The reduced soil moisture content eventually reduces the stomatal conductance, resulting in the decayed transpiration rate that we observe. However, at night, the soil moisture equilibrates as the root water uptake is drastically diminished to only $2.5$ g\,h$^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figdir/figure_transpirationrate_updated-crop_v2.pdf}
	\caption{Diurnal variation of mass loss $m$ (g) and the resulting transpiration rate $TR=\mathrm{d}m/\mathrm{d}t$ (g h$^{-1}$) for two wind conditions: \textit{no wind} and \textit{with wind} ($U_{ref}=1$ m\,s$^{-1}$). Note: A part of no-wind data is missing (between $06:00$ to $12:00$) due to a fault in data acquisition.}
	\label{fig:figure_transpirationrate}
\end{figure}

The influence of the varying transpiration rate is further investigated by studying the hygrothermal microclimate variables, air temperature $T$ ($^{\circ}$C) and relative humidity $\textit{RH}$ (\%) inside the plant foliage. The setup of the hygrothermal sensors was detailed in section \cref{subsec:windtunnelsetup}.  \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_humidity_v2} shows the diurnal variation of the air temperature and relative humidity inside the tree at various heights, with $T_1$ at the bottom of foliage and $T_6$ at the plant canopy ($\hat{z}=1$). The configuration is such that probes 1 to 5 are directly inside the plant foliage with $30$ mm offset. Furthermore, the ambient condition (\textit{air}) and the ground condition below the plant (\textit{ground}) is compared to study the influence of plant shading. \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_humidity_v2} shows that, in the \textit{no-wind} condition, there is a quantifiable drop over height in the air temperature and a substantial increase in the relative humidity, with peak $\textit{RH}=75\%$ during day time. During the night, the vertical variability in the environmental conditions within the foliage is smaller but still noticeable. All the sensors inside the plant foliage show lower temperatures compared to ambient temperature, both during day and night. However, the sensor at plant canopy height ($\hat{z}=1$), shows that the air temperature is noticeably higher than the ambient condition. This indicates that the plant canopy region is strongly influenced by the absorption of solar radiation, leading to higher leaf temperature and thereby heating up the air. Similar observation of such positive leaf-to-air temperature due to high solar radiation absorption have also been observed numerically \citep{Manickathan2018a}. However, in the shadow of the plant, we see that air temperature is lower than in the sunlight region. We must note that the soil is sealed so that water loss is simply due to transpiration of the leaves. Therefore, the cooling by the ground is attributed to the plant shading only resulting in less energy storage and leading to lower air temperatures.

	\label{fig:figure_airtemperature_humidity_v2}
%	\end{figure}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The impact of transpiration, i.e., local cool oasis, diminishes strongly when the wind is present. The increased ventilation of the plant foliage due to the wind is seen to reduce the cool oasis formed by the transpirative cooling indicated by the higher air temperature compared to the no wind conditions especially in the lower zone of the tree. This ventilation by wind also leads to lower relative humidity values in the tree. \cref{fig:figure_transpirationrate} shows that the influence of wind on transpiration rate is, however, more complex. When the relative humidity reduces, the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is known to rise \citep{Manickathan2018a}. Thus, at dawn, due to the high atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) (such as when VPD is low or high radiation intensity), the transpiration rate is substantially higher than in the \textit{no-wind} case. This observation is in line with the theory that transpiration scales with atmospheric evaporative demand \citep{McVicar2012}. At dawn, when the stomatal resistance is low (or stomatal conductance is high), the Penman-Monteith equation predicts an increasing transpiration rate with increasing wind speed \citep{Idso1977,nobel2009physicochemical}. However, as the day progresses, the transpiration rate is seen to equilibrate down to the \textit{no-wind} condition level. This is the result of the influence of wind speed on the leaf water use efficiency (WUE, i.e., carbon uptake rate for a given transpiration rate), resulting in a decreasing transpiration rate \citep{Dixon1983,nobel2009physicochemical,Schymanski2016}. As the day progresses, due to the high sensible heat flux providing efficient convective cooling to the leaves, it improves the plant’s ability to conserve water, reducing the stomatal conductance \citep{Idso1977}. Thus, even though there is higher wind speed and an equivalently higher AED, the transpiration rate is seen to be similar to that of the \textit{no-wind} condition.


\subsubsection*{Day versus night comparison of plant response}

	\label{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}
%\end{figure}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The average daily response of the plant and its influence on the climate are studied to understand the cooling provided by the plant. \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}(a-d) shows the median air temperature at various heights for the case \textit{no-wind} \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}(a-b) and \textit{wind} \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}(c-d), respectively. Furthermore, the figure differentiates the daytime (i.e., $08$:$00$ to $16$:$00$) and nighttime (i.e., $20$:$00$ to $04$:$00$) median air temperature (i.e., a temporal-averaging window size of 8 hours). The daytime and nighttime period were shortened to focus on the period that is nearly steady-state. The figure shows that the air temperature change is largest during the day. However, more interesting, the figure shows that, in the presence of wind, the air temperature inside the tree is more homogenized, whereas, without wind, a large vertical variability is observed. We see that the vertical profile of temperature and relative humidity is correlated with the leaf area density $\langle a \rangle_{\textit{xy}}$, where large air temperature change and humidity change is observed at regions of high leaf area density. Furthermore, the air temperature is seen to be related to the solar radiative heat flux $\langle q_{\textit{r,sw}} \rangle_{\textit{xy}}$ gradient, especially during \textit{no-wind} condition, shown in \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}e. At region on high change is solar radiation intensity, a stark increase in air temperature is observed, indicating high solar radiation absorption. The most significant cooling, i.e., providing the largest drop in air temperature, is present for the \textit{no-wind} condition during the day for heights between $0.29\le \hat{z} \le0.57$. Moreover, at these regions, we also observe a large increase in the relative humidity. We see that relative humidity is high where leaf area density is high. At regions of high LAD, there is a higher transpiration rate resulting in a higher transpirative cooling. Moreover, the enhanced effect of transpirative cooling and the generation of the local cool zone is seen to be only prevalent when the wind is low.

High air temperature is observed at the plant canopy region and is the result of high solar radiation absorption at this layer, as indicated by the solar radiative heat flux profile (\cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}e) As most of the solar radiation is absorbed in the plant canopy (i.e., top $20\%$ of the foliage), it can result in a large increase in leaf temperature (i.e., $T=25$ $^{\circ}$C) and thereby a strong increase in the air temperature \citep{Manickathan2018a}. Such gradient in radiation absorption results in the observed air temperature spike at plant canopy as indicated by probe 6 ($\hat{z}=1$). In contrast, for probes 1 to 5 ($\hat{z}=[0.29$, $0.44$, $0.57$, $0.71$, $0.86]$) that are within the foliage, which are at regions of low solar radiation intensity, significantly lower air temperature is observed.

To investigate the variation in leaf temperature and its link to transpiration and solar radiation, the leaf temperature at the exterior of the plant is measured through infrared thermography. \cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2} shows the diurnal variation of leaf surface temperature for \textit{wind} and \textit{no-wind} condition. The thermography shows that, during the \textit{wind} condition, the spatial variability in leaf temperature is minimal, especially during the night. Therefore, the convective cooling of the leaves homogenizes the vertical variability in the leaf temperature. This is especially evident when observing the \textit{no-wind} condition. During the \textit{no-wind} condition, the vertical variation in leaf temperature shows a high plant-canopy leaf temperature and a cool in-foliage leaf temperature, especially at the lower regions. This observation reflects the hygrothermal measurements inside the foliage (\cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}(a-d)), and the vertical distribution of the solar radiative heat flux (\cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}e). Where solar radiation intensity is high, there is a large increase in the leaf temperature. So, we see that solar radiation is largest contributor to the leaf temperature rise. At night (\cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2}a and \cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2}b), the spatial variability is negligible. Although, the wind is seen to reduce the leaf temperature due to increased convective heat transfer, as indicated by \cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2}c and \cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2}f.

During the transition between day and night, a faster and a stronger variability is observed, influenced by the abrupt change in the environmental condition. \cref{fig:IRimage_phasediagram_type3} shows the spatiotemporal variability of streamwise-averaged leaf temperature $\langle T_l \rangle_x$ for \textit{no-wind} and \textit{wind} conditions. The figure shows the vertical variability in leaf temperature over the progression of the day. The streamwise averaging is only performed on the pixels with foliage. We see that, as observed with the internal hygrothermal microclimate of the plant (\cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}), the variability is only prevalent during the daytime. Furthermore, the \textit{no-wind} condition shows stronger temporal and spatial change than the \textit{wind} condition. We see that, during the \textit{wind} condition, the enhanced convective cooling provided by the wind reduces the high leaf temperature at the plant-canopy where the solar radiation penetrates. Furthermore, we observe that the strongest cooling is observed in the middle regions of the plant foliage around dawn with $T_l\approx19$ $^{\circ}$C. This indicates that leaf transpiration is also present at parts of foliage where solar radiation is lower. As the day progress, however, we see a diminishing cooling effect from the plant, indicated by the rising foliage temperature. To better understand this temporal variation between the two wind conditions, we investigate the net spatially-averaged leaf temperature history. It must be noted that the leaf temperature that is measured using the infrared imaging is simply the outer plant foliage temperature. The leaf temperature inside the plant foliage is known to be different and closer to the air temperature \citep{Manickathan2018a}. The air temperature inside the plant foliage is seen to be lower and more uniform as indicated from the hygrothermal measurement, as shown in \cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_relativehumidity_profile}.

\cref{fig:Tprofile_2} shows the diurnal evolution of the net spatial-averaged leaf temperature $\langle T_l \rangle_{\textit{xz}}$ (i.e., average pixel-value of all pixels belonging to plant foliage shown in \cref{fig:IR_dayvsnight_windvsnowind_type2_v2}) comparing \textit{wind} and \textit{no-wind} conditions. We notice that the \textit{wind} condition and \textit{no-wind} condition responses are very similar with the \textit{no-wind} condition being more amplified. At \textit{no-cooling} stage, due to the delayed response of the plant results in the high overshoot of leaf temperature, which is compensated and corrected by the plant thereafter. However, we see that, during the \textit{high-cooling} stage, the transpiration rate spikes, as evident from plant transpiration rate measurement, \cref{fig:figure_transpirationrate}, resulting in the drastic cooling measured. By midday, the stomatal response equilibrates the necessary transpiration rate and we observe a quasi-steady leaf temperature and transpiration rate (\cref{fig:figure_transpirationrate}) and in-foliage air temperature (\cref{fig:figure_airtemperature_humidity_v2}). Furthermore, the equilibrium leaf temperature of plant foliage during the \textit{no-wind} condition is higher than for the \textit{wind} condition. This is the result of the overall higher plant canopy temperature due to the reduced convective heat transfer. As the day progresses, the leaf temperature transitions to the fourth stage (i.e., \textit{decaying-cooling} stage) with a slow increase in the leaf temperature. The observation correlates with the measured plant transpiration rate, \cref{fig:figure_transpirationrate}, where an equally decaying transpiration rate is observable.

\cref{fig:hysteresis_transpirationrate_vs_temp_v2} shows a diurnal cycle of the net leaf temperature versus plant transpiration rate hysteresis showing hysteresis: i.e., a delayed response resulting in a temporal cyclic pattern. \cref{fig:hysteresis_transpirationrate_vs_temp_v2}a and \cref{fig:hysteresis_transpirationrate_vs_temp_v2}c shows the hysteresis of plant transpiration rate with respect to plant canopy region leaf temperature for \textit{no-wind} and \textit{wind} condition, respectively. Whereas, \cref{fig:hysteresis_transpirationrate_vs_temp_v2}b and \cref{fig:hysteresis_transpirationrate_vs_temp_v2}d shows the hysteresis with respect to ground-region leaf temperature. We see that the hysteresis magnitude at the bottom is less amplified in contrast to the plant canopy leaf temperature. Furthermore, we observe that leaf temperature rises rapidity at the start of the day due to the absorption of solar radiation. After a delay, the transpiration helps to cool the leaves and reaches a quasi-equilibrium between transpiration rate and leaf temperature. In the absence of solar radiation (i.e., after dusk), the leaf temperature quickly decreases. However, we observe that the transpiration rate is not reduced at the same rate. Only after a delayed time-period, does the transpiration rate reduce, resulting in a slight increase in leaf temperature and reaching the night-time equilibrium state. This diurnal circular cyclic pattern of leaf temperature and transpiration rate, instead of simple linear variation, is observable due to delay in the stomatal response. The hysteresis occurs because the stomatal conductance is not just dependent on the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) such as light, temperature, and humidity, but also depends on the water transport within the xylem. The root water uptake and the resulting water transport through the plant are known to have a delayed response due to the capacitance on the sub-elements in the plant leaf-xylem-root system. The hysteresis due to the mismatch in transpiration demand and the root water uptake has been well documented in the past \citep{Dauzat2001, Williams1996}. An essential consequence of this dynamic plant response is that it is impossible to correctly parameterize vegetation in urban climate models without explicit modeling the water transport within the plant. Therefore, a higher-fidelity model that can model the dynamic water transport in the plant system is required to capture such hysteresis patterns \citep{Huang2017, Manzoni2011}. Furthermore, a simpler model might not be able to predict such rapid changes in leaf temperature when the environmental conditions abruptly change. For example, solar radiation might rapidly change due to changes in cloud cover or the changes in solar shading from nearby buildings, and rapid changes in AED due to changes in wind speed (such as gusts).     

\section{Conclusion}

The goal of the present study was to unveil the diurnal changes in plant microclimate using multiple non-intrusive imaging techniques such as stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) for the flow field, infrared thermography for the leaf temperature and X-ray tomography for the plant microstructure. The present study aimed at answering the following questions: What are the spatial and temporal variability of the plant performance due to environmental conditions such as wind speed and solar radiation? What is the diurnal response of the plant? 

The high-resolution measurement of the plant porosity through X-ray tomography enabled us to find that the aerodynamic and optical porosities typically used in the wind tunnel studies do not reflect the true porosity distribution of the plant. Moreover, the paper presents a novel approach of determining the leaf area density directly from X-ray tomography. The advantage of this non-intrusive approach of determining the plant microstructure enabled us to perform series of additional experiments, enabling us to directly quantify the impact of plant foliage morphology on the wake flow characteristics, the hygrothermal conditions such as air temperature and relative humidity inside the plant foliage, the solar radiation penetration inside the foliage and, finally, its impact on the spatial distribution of the leaf temperature. The SPIV measurement of the wake flow field helped us to find that at regions where porosity $\phi\rightarrow 1$, a strong bleed flow is observable, indicated by the mean velocity component. However, in contrast, there was no apparent link between the distribution of the plant porosity and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The TKE intensity was seen to be governed by the net plant porosity and the outer geometry of the plant foliage that generates the shear-layer and how it interacts with the upstream boundary layer profile. A parameteric study on the plant drag forces in \cref{subsec:dragcoeff} equivalent to a change in net porosity showed that the wake TKE intensity is negatively correlated with the plant porosity. For high plant porosity (i.e., very low plant drag), the TKE is minimally affected in the wake.

The hygrothermal measurement at multiple vertical locations within the plant foliage enabled us to find that the local cool zone generated by transpirative cooling quickly diminished when the wind is present. The diurnal measurement of the transpiration rate showed that the water use efficiency (WUE) changes during the day indicated by the decaying transpiration rate. Furthermore, the high-resolution infrared thermography measuring the spatial and temporal changes in the leaf temperature revealed further dynamic variability during the day. A comparison of the diurnal variation in the leaf temperature and the net plant transpiration rate enabled us to quantify the diurnal hysteresis resulting from the stomatal response lag. The plant day is seen to comprise of four unique stages \textit{no-cooling} (i.e., the stage when stomata has not responded to the increase in solar radiation),\textit{ high-cooling} (i.e., when stomatal response tries to compensate for increased leaf temperature), \textit{equilibrium} (i.e., when stomatal response and leaf temperature equilibrates) and \textit{decaying-cooling} stage (i.e., when the transpiration rate starts to weaken). Such plant responses are difficult to parameterize and simplify for urban climate-vegetation models without explicitly modeling the water transport within the plant. The challenge of such complex dynamics is that simplified models might not be able to predict rapid changes in leaf temperature due to the sudden change in atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) resulting from a sudden change in solar radiation (e.g. due to a sudden change in cloud cover) or sudden change in wind speed (e.g. due to gust). Therefore, higher-fidelity models of plant responses should take into account such dynamics that arise from water availability and the stomatal response delay, to accurately assess the transpirative cooling potential of vegetation. Therefore, in \cref{ch:numericalmethod}, we develop such numerical model that can be used to study to the impact of vegetation on urban microclimate (\cref{ch:impactofvegetation}). The sensitivity of plant transpiration to the water availability is modeled using a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum modeling approach (\cref{sec:spac}). A further contribution of the present chapter is to provide high-resolution multivariate measurement dataset for development and validation towards such advanced numerical methods. In \cref{ch:wtcfdcomparison}, the experimental dataset is used to compare the developed CFD model, albeit using a simpler version of the full-model. Due to complexity of the fully-coupled model, the present measurement campaign still lacks necessary inputs for the model calibration.
